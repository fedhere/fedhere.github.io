Although Stevenson usually fights as a [[super middleweight]], as of June 8, 2013 he is the reigning [[Lineal championship|Lineal]], [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], and [[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'']] [[light heavyweight]] champion. Stevenson won those titles from former champion [[Chad Dawson]] in his adopted hometown of Montreal.

Stevenson competed in the [[Boxing at the 2006 Commonwealth Games|XVIII Commonwealth Games]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] in 2006 and won the silver medal losing to Local [[Australia]]n, [[Jarrod Fletcher]] in the final. It was also the only medal a Canadian boxer received at the games.

He has a record of 33-5 in amateur contests.

==Professional career==

Stevenson turned professional in September 2006. 

On August 1, 2008, at [[Windsor Station (Montreal)|Windsor Station]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], Stevenson defeated [[Anthony Bonsante]] by first round [[knockout]]. The two fighters came out of their corners for the fight with Bonsante launching the first attack, but just moments after the assault, Stevenson landed a left hand that sent Bonsante down to the canvas. Bonsante sprawled out on the canvas with his eyes closed, while the referee reached the count of six before stopping the fight. Bonsante had begun to get up at the count of six, but it was too late, leaving Bonsante livid with the decision as he chased the referee around the ring in an attempt to protest the decision, but to little avail.<ref>{{cite web| last =Henderson, Jr.| first =Benny| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Bonsante tells the Doghouse, I was down but not out!| work =| publisher =Doghouse Boxing| date =2008-08-02| url =http://www.doghouseboxing.com/Henderson/DHBenny080208.htm| doi =| accessdate =2008-08-02 }}

</ref> He also won a fifth round TKO decision against Jermain Mackey on September 25, 2009.

On April 17, 2010, in his first fight in the United States, which also was his first time fighting for promoter [[Lou DiBella]], he suffered his first defeat being stopped in the second round by Darnell Boone. Boone had been knocked down on the canvas twice in the first round, however, in the second round, Stevenson rushed to Boone without maintaining his defense and he got caught by a solid right sending him on the canvas for the first time in his career. Stevenson managed to get back on his feet inside the count of 10, however, the referee ended the fight even if Stevenson seemed ready to continue the bout.

Nonetheless, Stevenson resumed with GYM Promotions and won the North American title NABA on April 8, 2011 at the expense of Derek Edwards by KO in the third round. He then won by referee stoppage in the first round against Dion Savage (Shujaa El-Amin) on September 17, 2011, and retained his title against Aaron Pryor Jr on December 10, 2011 by referee stoppage in the ninth round. Stevenson jumped from 15th to 2nd position for the IBF title, winning by KO in the first round duel against [[Jesus Gonzalez (boxer)|Jesus Gonzalez]] on February 18, 2012.<ref>[http://tvasports.ca/video/1460429621001 TVASports February 18, 2012 (French)]</ref><ref>[http://tvasports.ca/video/1464794765001 TVASports February 21, 2012 (French)]</ref> He then fought [[Noe Gonzalez Alcoba|Noe Gonzalez]] on April 20, 2012 and won the fight at 1:40 in the second round when the referee stopped the fight.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boxing: Canada's Stevenson overpowers Gonzalez|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/more-sports/boxing-canadas-stevenson-overpowers-gonzalez/article4101541/|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref>

His next fight originally set to be against Don George with the winner getting a shot at the IBF champion. The fight was originally scheduled to be a co/main event of a [[fight card]] also including a match between [[Jean Pascal]] and [[Tavoris Cloud]] on August 11, 2012 but the even was cancelled due to an injury suffered by Pascal. The Stevenson fight was then moved up to August 17, 2012 and was set to be part part of [[ESPN Friday Night Fights]], <ref>{{cite web|title=Adonis Stevenson fights Don George in IBF 168 lb eliminator on August 17th|url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/2012/adonis-stevenson-fights-don-george-in-ibf-168-lb-eliminator-on-august-17th/|work=East Side Boxing|accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref> but Stevenson later injured his hand cancelling the fight.<ref>http://www.boxingnews24.com/2012/08/adonis-stevenson-injures-hand-fridays-fight-with-don-george-off/</ref> The fight was then rescheduled to October 12.<ref>http://www.badlefthook.com/2012/8/28/3275679/adonis-stevenson-vs-don-george-rescheduled-october-12-2012-montreal-wealth-tv-boxing-news</ref> In the fight Stevenson knocked George down twice in the fifth and once in the sixth round before winning the fight with a 12th round TKO after knocking him down twice more.<ref>http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/more-sports/canadas-stevenson-stops-george-in-12th-round-to-win-wild-ibf-eliminator/article4611140/</ref>

Stevenson avenged his only loss, knocking out Darnell Boone with a pair of lefts in the sixth round in March 22, 2013 at the Bell Centre. The left-hander, fighting at 171.9 pounds, forced Boone to take a knee with a right hook to the body early in the sixth, then stunned him coming out of a corner with a left uppercut, followed with a straight left that sent Boone on the canvas.

After failing to procure a title match at super middleweight, Stevenson decided to move up to light heavyweight to face [[Chad Dawson]] on June 8, 2013. Stevenson hit Dawson with a left hook that dropped him very early in the first round of the fight, and although Dawson got up before the count of eight the referee stopped the fight giving Stevenson an unexpected knockout victory. Stevenson's victory was his eighth straight since his only career defeat, all coming by knockout.

The WBC originally ordered Stevenson to face mandatory challenger [[Tony Bellew]], but then allowed him to make a voluntary defense first against [[Tavoris Cloud]], where the winner of the fight must face Bellew at a later date.<ref>http://www.eastsideboxing.com/2013/wbc-gives-permission-for-adonis-stevenson-v-tavoris-cloud-fight-to-go-ahead/</ref> The Stevenson/Cloud bout is close to being finalized and is expected to occur on September 28, 2013 with Stevenson's WBC Light Heavyweight Championship on the line.<ref>http://espn.go.com/blog/dan-rafael/post/_/id/4637/stevenson-cloud-deal-is-near</ref>

Stevenson is a product of [[Kronk Gym]], which was run by [[Emanuel Steward]] prior to his 2012 death.
