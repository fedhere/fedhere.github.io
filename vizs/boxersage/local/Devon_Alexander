'''Devon Alexander''' (born February 10, 1987) is a professional [[United States|American]] [[Boxing|boxer]]. Nicknamed "Alexander the Great," he is the former [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] and [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[Light Welterweight]] champion.

==Biography==

Alexander grew up in the Hyde Park neighborhood of north St. Louis, in an area described as downtrodden, rough, gang- and drug-infested.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/the_bonus/03/02/alexander/index.html|title=Devon Alexander escaped streets of St. Louis to become a champion|accessdate=2010-03-15 |date=2010-03-03|work=SportsIllustrated.cnn.com}}</ref> Alexander was mentored by many people at a young age including Former NFL players Eric Drain and Demetrius Johnson, principal of Clay Community Education Center Frank Muelhauser, and PE teacher, Brad Slinkard.  He would later join the boxing gym that [[Kevin Cunningham]], a former police officer and security officer at Clay Community Center, turned trainer, founded in the basement of an old police station.<ref name="espn.go.com">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/boxing/notebook/_/id/4966812/devon-alexander-not-letting-praise-get-head|title=Alexander Not Letting Praise Get To His Head|accessdate=2010-03-06 |date=2010-03-05|work=Espn.com}}</ref>

Thirty kids joined the boxing program of Cunningham, who had hoped to keep the kids out of trouble, off the streets, and in the ring. A stablemate of Alexander's, [[Cory Spinks]] would become [[welterweight]] champion. .<ref name="canadaeast.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.canadaeast.com/sports/article/974850|title=Devon Alexander rises from mean streets to become world champ|accessdate=2010-03-06 |date=2010-03-05|work=CanadaEast.com}}</ref>

==Amateur career==

Alexander had an outstanding amateur career, compiling a record of 300-10 under the tutelage of Cunningham. He was a four-time [[Silver Gloves]] champion from ages 10–14; three-time [[Police Athletic League|PAL]] national champion; Junior Golden Gloves and [[AAU Junior Olympic Games|Junior Olympics]] national champion; 2003 United States national champion in the 19-and-under division; and 2004 [[National Amateur Light Welterweight Champions|United States light welterweight national champion]]. Alexander made it to the final round of the 2004 Olympic trials, where he battled [[Rock Allen]] to a draw and was knocked down once before losing on a tie-breaker.<ref name="01/18">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&id=12162 |title=New School Pick of the Week: Devon Alexander |accessdate=2008-01-23 |last=Donovan |first=Jake |date=2008-01-18 |work=BoxingScene.com}}</ref>

==Professional career==

===Light Welterweight===
At age 17, Alexander made his professional debut, defeating Vincent Torres by first round [[technical knockout]] in [[Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan]].<ref name="01/18"/> He was victorious in his second pro fight against Karl Hunter before on February 5, 2005, Alexander defeated Donovan Castaneda by unanimous decision in front of 22,370 spectators, the second-largest crowd in history to witness a boxing event in an indoor arena at the [[Savvis Center]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Alexander’s mentor, [[Cory Spinks]], headlined the card opposing [[Zab Judah]].<ref name="01/14">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2008/01/devon-alexander-profile/ |title=Devon Alexander Profile |accessdate=2008-01-23 |date=2008-01-14 |work=BoxingNews24.com}}</ref>

Alexander won his next five fights before on July 8, 2006, at the Savvis Center in St. Louis, Missouri, Alexander defeated Tyler Ziolkowski by first round technical knockout to win the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Youth welterweight title, but was himself knocked down once in the fight.<ref name="01/14"/>

On January 6, 2007, Alexander defeated Maximinio Cuevas by fourth round technical knockout at the [[Hard Rock Cafe|Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino]] in [[Hollywood, Florida]]. In his next fight, Alexander fought Scott Ball on March 2, 2007, at the [[Belterra Casino Resort & Spa]] in Belterra, Indiana. Alexander was down in the second round himself but broke Ball's jaw in round six and dropped him twice in round seven en route to a technical knockout victory.<ref name="01/14"/>

He won his next two fights against Marcus Luck and Cory Peterson before he went up against former [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] junior welterweight champion [[DeMarcus Corley]] on January 19, 2008, at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]]. Alexander easily defeated Corley by unanimous decision to claim the vacant WBC Continental Americas junior welterweight title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2008/01/alexander-decisions-corley-collazo-defeats-barros/ |title=Alexander Decisions Corley, Collazo Defeats Barros |accessdate=2008-01-23 |date=2008-01-21 |work=BoxingNews24.com}}</ref>

====Light Welterweight title====
On August 1, 2009, Alexander defeated [[Junior Witter]] to claim the vacant [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[light welterweight]] championship. Witter gave up on his stool after the eighth round, claiming that he had re-injured his left hand. Alexander was hurt by a right hand in round 2. All three judges had Alexander ahead at the time of the stoppage 79-73, 79-73, 80-72.

====Alexander vs. Urango====
Alexander was next scheduled to face two-time champion [[Juan Urango]] of [[Colombia]] in a title unification bout. The 6 March 2010 bout was held at the [[Mohegan Sun]] in Uncasville, Connecticut and was televised on [[HBO]]'s "Boxing After Dark" telecast.<ref name="espn.go.com"/> To train for the fight, Alexander used a Las Vegas house lent by promoter [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]] as training base.<ref name="canadaeast.com"/>  Devon Alexander defeated Juan Urango by TKO in round 8.
Alexander threw an uppercut which dropped Urango. Urango made the count but Alexander resumed his attack and threw a hook to Urango's temple which again dropped him. Urango stood up but was clearly dazed, resulting in a stoppage by the referee. Urango, who suffered his first KO defeat, called out Timothy Bradley after the fight, but a fight was never made because Bradley just moved up to welterweight.

In his next fight he faced [[Andreas Kotelnik]], the former WBA Light Welterweight champion, in his hometown of St. Louis Missouri on 7 August in front of members of the [[St. Louis Rams]], [[Evander Holyfield]] and [[Floyd Mayweather]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/boxing/fights/index.html#/boxing/fights/2010/03-06-devon-alexander-vs-juan-urango/article/fight-update.html|title=The Matador: Alexander Unified Champion|accessdate=2010-03-16 |date=2010-03-06|work=HBO.com}}</ref> Alexander won the fight by a controversial unanimous decision with all judges scoring the fight 116-112. 

On October 22, 2010, Alexander was stripped of the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] Junior Welterweight title for not fighting the no. 1 contender, [[Kaizer Mabuza]].

====Alexander vs. Bradley====
{{Main|Timothy Bradley vs. Devon Alexander}}
Alexander's next fight, on January 29, 2011, took place against [[Timothy Bradley]], which he lost via 10th round TD after an unintentional head-butt forced a stop to the bout.<ref name="boxrec.com">http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=254834&cat=boxer</ref>

====Alexander vs. Matthysse====
{{Main|Devon Alexander vs. Lucas Matthysse}}
On June 25, 2011, Alexander beat Lucas Matthysse in a disputed split decision. The fight seemed like a slight win for Matthysse, who knocked down Alexander in the fourth round and landed harder shots. The  judges, however, scored the fight 96-93 and 95-94 for Alexander and 96-93 for Matthysse.

===Welterweight===
{{Main|Devon Alexander vs. Marcos Maidana}}
On February 25, 2012 Alexander moved up to welterweight and put on a dominating performance against highly-regarded and hard-charging [[Marcos Maidana]]. Alexander landed the right hook at will, catching Maidana with his left hand down throughout the contest. Maidana was seemingly surprised by both the speed and power Alexander displayed at his first fight at welterweight. Only one of the three judges had Maidana winning a round. The impressive nature of the win earned Alexander a title match with [[Randall Bailey]] in September 2012. Alexander was criticized by some however, for fighting illegally at some points during the fight.

Alexander was scheduled to fight titlest [[Randall Bailey]] as a main event on [[Showtime Championship Boxing]] on September 8, 2012, but Bailey withdrew due to injury. Their fight was replaced with the original undercard fight between [[Olusegun Ajose]] and [[Lucas Matthysse]] and an originally scheduled non-televised fight between [[J'Leon Love]] and [[Ramon Valenzuela]] was changed to a televised bout.<ref>http://espn.go.com/blog/dan-rafael/post/_/id/1804/love-valenzuela-elevated-to-co-main-event</ref>

====Welterweight title====
Alexander returned to action on October 20, 2012, at the [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn]], where he won the IBF Welterweight title by unanimous decision against ''Ring'' Top 10 Welterweight, [[Randall Bailey]]. The fight was fought at a comfortable pace for Alexander, with very little exchanges, as Bailey did not let his hands go very often. In a one sided fight, Alexander won his third world title in his second division.

Alexander's next fight was originally suppose to happen on January 19, 2013, against mandatory challenger and ''Ring'' No. 3 ranked Welterweight, [[Kell Brook]]. However, Brook suffered an ankle injury during training, and the fight has been rescheduled for May 18, 2013 in Atlantic City. Alexander's camp and some boxing insiders have questioned the authenticity of this injury and instead assert that Brook was simply not ready to step up in class to fight Alexander.

====Devon Alexander vs. Amir Khan====
Devon Alexander is set to defend his IBF Welterweight title against British former junior welterweight world champion Amir Khan in Khan's first welterweight bout. The fight is proposed to take place in Dubai. It will most likely happen on December 7, as per comments from Golden Boy Promotion's CEO Richard Schaefer, due to Amir Khan's recent marriage commitments and his obligation to observe Ramadan in July and August 2013.
