===Title challenges vs. Edwards and Haskins===
McDonnell's first fight outside his home town saw him travel to the [[York Hall]] in [[Bethnal Green]] to defeat Nikita Lukin on 21 September 2007 in an 8 round fight.  His next fight was to be for the British super-flyweight title at the Robin Park Centre in [[Wigan]] on 8 December 2007.  The fight with [[Chris Edwards (boxer)|Chris Edwards]] would be the first time the British super-flyweight had been contested making this the inaugural contest for the belt.  The experienced Edwards eventually won the title via a split decision after 12 hotly contested rounds handing a first defeat for the [[Doncaster]] man.<ref>[http://www.fightwriter.com/?q=node/1328 Fightwriter | Chris Edwards vs Jamie McDonnell]</ref>

On 28 March 2008 McDonnell suffered his second defeat in a row having travelled to [[Barnsley]] to meet [[Bristol|Bristol's]] [[Lee Haskins]].  The fight with Haskins resulted in another close loss over 8 rounds with [[Lee Haskins|Haskins]] himself coming off a British title loss to [[Ian Napa]] in the bantamweight division.  The fight in [[Barnsley]] doubled as an eliminator for the winner to challenge for the Super Flyweight title which Haskins would go on to win.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/7505747.stm BBC Sport | Haskins gets British title chance]</ref>

===British bantamweight champion===
Following two straight defeats to British level fighters, McDonnell regrouped by returning to [[Doncaster]] and beating journeyman Anthony Hanna via a fifth round stoppage.  Two fights on the island of [[Jersey]] then followed with McDonnell scoring stoppage wins over imports Krastan Krastanov and Alain Bonnel before travelling back to [[Doncaster]] to defeat Scotland's James Ancliff again before the final bell had been heard.  On 22 January 2010 McDonnell got his chance to fight for the British title once more, this time for the bantamweight version held by the experienced [[Ian Napa]].  The fight, at the [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood Centre]] in Essex, saw a tough battle result in an upset split decision win for McDonnell with the added bonus of the vacant Commonwealth belt also being on the line.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/8476327.stm BBC Sport | Jamie McDonnell stuns Ian Napa to win British title]</ref>

===European bantamweight champion===
McDonnell's victory over Napa allowed him to step straight away into a challenge for the European title against the Frenchman [[Jerome Arnould]].  The fight, in [[Cannes]] on 20 March 2010, resulted in a surprise victory for the man from [[Doncaster]] with a 10th round stoppage over Arnould to lift his third title in a row.<ref>[http://news.boxrec.com/news/2010/mcdonnell-eurostar Boxrec news | McDonnell a Eurostar]</ref>  McDonnell made his first defence at the Doncaster Dome on 2 July 2010 against the newly crowned Italian champion Rodrigo Bracco and managed to retain the belt with a third round stoppage win.<ref>[http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12183_6242947,00.html Sky Sports | McDonnell retains his crown]</ref>  He returned to the Dome for his second defence on 22 January 2011 beating Belgian boxer [[Stephane Jamoye]] in a close contest with scores of 115-113 114-113 114-114 despite having a point deducted in the 11th round.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/9370885.stm BBC Sport | Jamie McDonnell retains European bantamweight title]</ref>  McDonnell chose to defend the Commonwealth belt he won against [[Ian Napa]] in his next fight in Sheffield on 28 May 2011.  Had he lost the contest then McDonnell would have been stripped of his European title but there were no such concerns as he scored a unanimous points decision over Kenyan Nick Otieno.  Following the fight, promoter [[Frank Maloney]] said that a potential unification match with British champion [[Stuart Hall (boxer)|Stuart Hall]] could be on the cards and that it was a fight that both the fans and the boxers themselves wanted to happen. Jamie Mcdonnell fought Stuart Hall on the 3rd of September 2011 and won via unanimous decision to reclaim the British title.<ref>[http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12183_6957736,00.html Sky sports | McDonnell retains titles]</ref>
