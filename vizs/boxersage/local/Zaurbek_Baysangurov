'''Zaurbek Baysangurov''' (born March 2, 1985) is a Russian [[Boxing|boxer]] and the current [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] and [[WBO]] Light Middleweight Champion.

==Amateur==
Chechen junior middleweight Baysangurov is a two-times world amateur junior championship bronze medalist (U17 World Championships in 2001 and World Junior Championships 2002 in Cuba) and Russian amateur junior Champion.

==Pro==
He turned pro for German promoter Sauerland in 2004 at age 18.  Hard hitting veteran [[Marco Antonio Rubio]], 34-4-1 (30) put him on the deck in 2006 but was soundly outpointed.  Baysangurov won the European championship in July 2007 with a very close decision over a little-known Frenchman.

In December 2008 he lost via an upset 5th round KO to former [[The Contender 2|The Contender]] star [[Cornelius Bundrage]].
