As an amateur, he won two [[Amateur Boxing Association of England|ABA]] [[Middleweight]] titles in 1999 and 2001 and a bronze medal at the [[2001 World Amateur Boxing Championships]] before turning pro and having his first pro fight in March 2002.

Cobraboxing.com (2012-05-25). Retrieved on 2013-03-01.</ref>

During his amateur career, he lost a fight to [[Denis Inkin]], who he was scheduled to fight in a title eliminator in 2008, but Inkin pulled out on three occasions.{{Citation needed|date= May 2012}}
Interestingly, he also boxed Jason Booth when a teenager on more than one occasion. Booth went on to fight as a professional at Flyweight to Super bantamweight.

== Professional career ==
Froch is trained by [[Robert McCracken]] and managed by Eddie Hearn. In 2004, he won the vacant British and Commonwealth championships. He has defended both against [[Brian Magee]], [[Tony Dodson]], [[Matthew Barney]] and [[Damon Hague]], and the Commonwealth belt alone against Ruben Groenewald and Dale Westerman.

Following a victory over the Russian [[Sergey Tatevosyan]], on the 9 November 2007 at Trent FM Arena in Nottingham he stopped veteran ex-world champion [[Robin Reid (boxer)|Robin Reid]], after saw Reid retire from the sport for four years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/boxing/2011/02/24/robin-reid-comes-out-of-retirement-after-mum-s-blessing-100252-28225440/|title=Robin Reid comes out of retirement after mum’s blessing|date=24 February 2011|accessdate=18 November 2012|publisher=liverpoolecho.co.uk|first=Philip|last=Kirkbride}}</ref>

On 10 May 2008, at the Trent FM Arena in Nottingham Carl Froch stopped unbeaten Polish Albert Rybacki in the 4th round of a scheduled 12. Rybacki was drafted in as a last-minute replacement after initial opponent [[Denis Inkin]] pulled out on two occasions and no Top 30 fighter was willing to take the fight at two weeks' notice.{{Citation needed|date= May 2012}}

=== Froch vs Pascal ===
On 6 December 2008, Froch fought [[Canadian]] [[Jean Pascal]] for the vacant [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[super middleweight]] title and won after a hard-fought 12-round brawl.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/2008-12-06-1627686878_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Froch beats Pascal on points for super-middle belt | date=2008-12-06 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref> Both combatants showed enormous grit and determination, landing and taking huge shots from one another without even flinching. After the fight, it was revealed that Froch had sustained a perforated eardrum and a cracked rib in his final sparring session before the fight. Froch's promoter Mick Hennessy gave Froch the opportunity to withdraw from the fight, but Froch refused.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxingandmma/3660285/Carl-Froch-beat-Jean-Pascal-to-become-world-champion-despite-a-perforated-eardrum-Boxing.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Gareth A | last=Davies | title=Carl Froch beat Jean Pascal to become world champion despite a perforated eardrum | date=2008-12-07}}</ref>
Since the fight, Froch and Pascal (who has since become a [[light heavyweight|light-heavyweight]] champion) have become friends on a personal level and have made a promise to face each other again in the future.{{Citation needed|date= May 2012}}

=== Froch vs Taylor ===
{{Main|Carl Froch vs. Jermain Taylor}}
On 25 April 2009, Froch fought [[Jermain Taylor]] in his first defence of his WBC super middleweight title, at the Foxwoods Resort in Foxwoods, Connecticut. Froch survived a third-round knockdown – the first of his entire career, amateur and professional – and, behind on two of the three judges' cards coming into the final round, he managed to stop his opponent with 14 seconds remaining in the 12th round to retain his WBC super-middleweight title.

After the fight, Froch was quick to send out a verbal challenge to unbeaten [[Welsh people|Welsh]] boxer [[Joe Calzaghe]] and was also quoted as saying "Kessler, Pavlik, Hopkins, I want them all to feel the force."<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/8013772.stm | work=BBC News | title=Froch stuns Taylor with late show | date=2009-04-26 | accessdate=2010-04-28 | first=Ben | last=Dirs}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-1093988/Britains-new-champion-Froch-lines-Taylor-defence.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Britain's new champion Froch lines up Taylor for first defence | date=2008-12-11}}</ref>

=== Super Six World Boxing Classic ===
{{Main|Super Six World Boxing Classic}} 
On 13 July, Froch agreed to take part in the [[Super Six World Boxing Classic]] super middleweight tournament devised by American giant [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. The tournament features 6 boxers including [[Andre Dirrell]], [[Mikkel Kessler]], [[Arthur Abraham]], [[Jermain Taylor]], [[Andre Ward]] and Froch himself. Froch's first opponent in the Super Six was [[Andre Dirrell]].

==== Andre Dirrell ====
The bout took place in Nottingham on 17th October and Froch's WBC title was on the line. Froch won the fight and retained his title with a split decision victory over the previously undefeated [[Andre Dirrell]].<ref>Iorfida, Chris (2009-10-19) [http://www.cbc.ca/sports/blogs/2009/10/win_for_froch_a_crock.html Chris Iorfida, CBC Sports].

==== Mikkel Kessler ====
Froch's next fight was against [[Mikkel Kessler]], who lost the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] [[List of super middleweight boxing champions|super-middleweight title]] to [[Andre Ward]].<ref>[http://sports.yahoo.com/box/news;_ylt=AlPklzYCfKQzYz1maSKdfFmUxLYF?slug=ap-kessler-ward&prov=ap&type=lgns ]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> Froch's WBC title was again on the line. In a closely fought contest in Kessler's home country of [[Denmark]] where both men had great moments throughout the fight, Kessler took Froch's title and inflicted Froch's first professional defeat via unanimous decision, the judges scoring the contest by margins of 116–112, 115–113 and 117–111. The scoring was some what controversial, as some boxing announcers had scored the fight much closer, with some awarding Froch the win and others scoring it a draw.<ref>[http://www.onlinesportshandicapping.com/news-9/fight-picks/092710-boxing-news-arthur-abraham-vs-carl-froch-odds.html Boxing News: Arthur Abraham vs Carl Froch Odds].

==== Arthur Abraham ====
Froch faced former IBF middleweight champion Hard hitting King [[Arthur Abraham]] in the third stage in Helsinki Finland at the Hartwall Finland fearing that if he fought in Abraham's adoptive home country he might get mugged. However, since an eye injury forced [[Mikkel Kessler]] to relinquish his WBC title and resign from the tournament, Froch-Abraham was for the vacant WBC super middleweight title. Both Froch and Abraham came off of a loss in stage two of the Super Six. Abraham lost after a disqualification against former Froch victim [[Andre Dirrell]].

Froch regained the WBC super middleweight title by gaining a unanimous points victory over Arthur Abraham in [[Helsinki]]. Many {{Who| date= May 2012}} doubted Froch would last the distance against the more powerful Abraham and that made Abraham the bookies' favouite, Abraham would knock him out. Pundits {{Who| date= May 2012}} also felt that Froch's awkward and unorthodox hands by his waist style would be no match for Abraham's power. Froch won the fight against Abraham in a dominant manner, with the scores given by the judges of 119–109, 120–108 and 120–108, reflecting the one-sided nature of the bout.<ref>[http://www.sportinglife.com/boxing/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=boxing/10/11/27/BOXING_Froch_Nightlead.html ]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>

==== Glen Johnson ====
Off the heels of his victory over Abraham, Froch entered the semifinal stage of the tournament. His semifinal opponent on 4 June 2011 in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] was [[Glen Johnson (boxer)|Glen Johnson]]. Froch retained his title with a majority decision victory, with the scores given by the judges of 116–112, 117–111, and 114–114.<ref>Christ, Scott.

Retrieved on 2013-03-01.</ref> After the fight Froch criticised the Japanese judge Nobuaki Uratani in an interview on Sky's Ringside show remarking that he "must have fallen asleep after round 3."{{Cite quote| date= May 2012}}

==== Andre Ward ====
{{Main|Andre Ward vs. Carl Froch}}
Carl Froch lost in the final of the Super Six World Boxing Classic tournament in a dramatic bout against WBA super middleweight champion Andre Ward. The vacant The Ring super middleweight title would be on the line in the fight, as well as Froch and Ward's super middleweight titles. In the first 7 rounds, Ward outboxed Froch, successfully using his jab to neutralize Froch and beating Froch to the punch from a distance and at close range. In the later rounds, Ward seemed to take his foot off the gas, leaving Froch to win a couple rounds near the end of the fight, though they were close and fairly competitive rounds. The judges scorecards were 115–113, 115–113 and 118–110, all in favor of Ward. Ward won the vacant The Ring super middleweight title.

=== Bute vs Froch ===
{{Main|Carl Froch vs. Lucian Bute}}

The fight, billed as "No Easy Way Out", took place on 26 May 2012 in Froch's hometown of [[Nottingham]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.livefight.com/news.php?news_id=1799&y=2012&m=02 | work=LiveFight | title=IBF make Carl Froch the number one mandatory to Bute | date=2012-02-09}}</ref> Despite being the underdog with bookmakers, critics and fans around the world, Froch dominated Bute throughout the fight to become the new IBF super-middleweight champion via TKO in round five, making Froch a three-time world champion.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/may/27/carl-froch-lucian-bute-world-title?newsfeed=true Carl Froch destroys Lucian Bute to capture IBF world title | Sport | The Observer].
