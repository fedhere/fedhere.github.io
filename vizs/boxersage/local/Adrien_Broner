==Professional boxer==

===Super Featherweight===
Adrien Broner is a fighter who turned professional on 31 May 2008 and scored three consecutive first round knockouts against Allante Davis, David Warren Huffman and Ramon Flores. In Broner's fourth fight he faced Terrance Jett at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] on the undercard of the [[Ricky Hatton]] vs [[Paulie Malignaggi]] fight. Broner defeated Jett with a stoppage in the sixth round. In Broner's fifth professional fight and final of 2008, he faced Scott Furney on the undercard of [[Oscar De La Hoya]] vs [[Manny Pacquiao]] fight. Broner stopped Furney in the first round bringing his record to 5(5)-0-0.

In January 2009 he was forced to go the distance with Jose Alfredo Lugo, at the [[Staples Center]] on the undercard of [[Shane Mosley]] vs [[Antonio Margarito]]. Broner returned to the ring in March scoring a unanimous decision over Eric Ricker. Three weeks later Broner stopped Angel Rodriguez in the fourth round. In his eighth fight Broner stepped up to eight rounds in a hard fought fight with Fernando Quintero, pulling out a controversial majority decision victory in a fight that Quintero took on 4 days' notice. In June at the [[Staples Center]] Broner met [[Australia]]n William Kickett, scoring a sixth round knockout. On the [[Juan Díaz (boxer)|Juan Díaz]] vs [[Paul Malignaggi]] undercard in [[Houston]] Broner make short work of Edgar Portillo, victory coming via stoppage in the first round. Broner defeated Henry White Jr via [[KO]] in September and finished his busy year against Tommy Atencio. Broner stopped Atencio in the first round, for the sixth time in thirteen fights. Broner then had a fourth round stoppage victory over Roberto Acevedo. Broner fought 4 more times in 2010 against Rafael Lora, Carlos Claudio, Guillermo Sanchez, and Ilido Julio, stopping all of them.

====Broner vs. Ponce De Leon====
Broner took his first major step up in weight when he competed against [[Daniel Ponce de León]] on March 5, 2011. In what was truly a very closely contested fight, Broner came away with a controversial unanimous decision victory. [[Harold Lederman]] scored the fight: 96-94, in Ponce De Leon's favour.

====Broner vs. Litzau====
Broner's next fight was on HBO's Boxing After Dark show from [[Guadalajara, Mexico]], Adrien Broner took on Top 10 Super Featherweight contender [[Jason Litzau]] in a fight scheduled for ten rounds. Broner landed combos on the ropes late in the first, with a straight right,  left hook and then a right uppercut hurting the Minnesotan badly. He crumpled, and the ref leaped in, seeing he was out.  The official end came at 2:58 of the first round.

====Broner vs. Rodriguez====
After having no luck in securing a fight [[Ricky Burns]], the former WBO super featherweight champion, to fight him on November 26, 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/warren-burns-heading-lightweight-wbo-title-shot--43603 |title=Warren: Burns Heading To Lightweight, WBO Title Shot - Boxing News |publisher=Boxingscene.com |date=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}</ref> Broner fought contender [[Vicente Martin Rodriguez]] on the undercard of the [[Saul Alvarez vs. Kermit Cintron]] fight card on HBO as part of a double header.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2011/10/adrien-broner-to-fight-vicente-martin-rodrigues-on-november-26th-on-alvarez-cintron-undercard/ |title=Adrien Broner to fight Vicente Martin Rodriguez on November 26th on Alvarez-Cintron undercard |publisher=Boxingnews24.com |date=2011-10-16 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}</ref> He defeated Rodriguez by knockout in the third round, to win the vacant WBO Super Featherweight World title.

====Broner vs. Perez====
Broner made a successful first defense of his WBO belt against Top 10 Super Featherweight contender and mandatory challenger [[Eloy Perez]] on a Feb. 25, 2012 HBO-televised card.<ref>{{cite web|last=Satterfield |first=Lem |url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/blog/170611-broner-perez-targeted-for-alexander-maidana-card- |title=Broner-Perez a done deal for Alexander-Maidana card &#124; RingTV |publisher=Ringtv.craveonline.com |date=2011-12-08 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}</ref>
with a knockout victory. Broner controlled the pace and action from start to finish, beating Perez to the punch and walking him down with ease. The fight ended when Broner landed a straight hand on Perez, followed by another right hand as Perez was going down.

====Broner vs. Escobedo====
Broner's next scheduled fight was to be on July 21, 2012, at the [[U.S. Bank Arena]] in Cincinnati, against Super Featherweight contender [[Vicente Escobedo]]. However, at weigh-in for the fight on July 20, Broner was 133 1/2 pounds, well over the 130-pound limit for the Super Featherweight class, and was automatically stripped of his title. The fight went on as scheduled and Broner won by 5th round TKO when Escobedo's corner threw in the towel.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rafael |first=Dan |url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/8185081/adrien-broner-stripped-title-not-making-130-pound-weight-limit-weigh-junior-lightweight-title-defense-mandatory-challenger-vicente-escobedo |title=Adrien Broner stripped of title |publisher=ESPN |date=2012-07-20 |accessdate=2012-07-21}}</ref>

===Lightweight===
====Broner vs. DeMarco====
[[File:Adrien Broner vs. Antonio DeMarco.jpg|right|250px|Broner during his Lightweight title fight against Antonio DeMarco, November 2012.]]
Broner's next fight was scheduled for November 17, 2012, in [[Atlantic City]] at [[Boardwalk Hall]], and was aired on HBO. The fight marked Broner's debut in the Lightweight division. The opponent was the WBC Lightweight champion and ''Ring'' No. 1-ranked Lightweight, [[Antonio DeMarco]]. Broner started the fight off boxing DeMarco, working behind his jab and using his shoulder roll defense to frustrate DeMarco. In the early rounds, Broner was able to hit DeMarco with his quick counter left hook several times. By the 4th round, Broner and DeMarco decided to stand toe-to-toe in the center of the ring and trade punches. It was Broner who got the better of the inside fight though, with his speed and quick combination punching taking its toll on DeMarco. By the 6th round, DeMarco had cut and his face swollen in several places, as he still opted to stand toe-to-toe with Broner, with Broner barely missing his right uppercuts and working the body of DeMarco as well. Then, in the 8th round, Broner opened up another fast combination which hurt DeMarco and than a swinging left uppercut sent DeMarco to the canvas for the first time in his career. DeMarco's corner stopped the fight right after the knockdown, giving Broner his second world title in as many weight classes.

CompuBox had Broner landing 241 of his 451 total punches. After the fight, Broner said he'd be interested in fighting Mexican boxer [[Juan Manuel Márquez]] and current WBO Lightweight champion [[Ricky Burns]]. Broner is set to make his first title defense on February 16, 2013, at Boardwalk Hall in [[Atlantic City]].{{update-inline|date=May 2013}} Having no luck at getting fellow Lightweight champion Ricky Burns to fight him in February, Broner is set{{When|date=May 2013}} to fight ''Ring'' No. 6-ranked Lightweight [[Gavin Rees]].

====Broner vs. Rees====
Broner stopped Rees in five rounds, after Rees' corner threw in the towel at the end of the round. Rees had some success early, when Broner was clowning and showboating, landing jabs and body shots. By round 3, Broner was in complete control, hitting Rees with his counter left hook at will, as well as hitting Rees at will on the inside. In the 4th round, Broner sent Rees to the canvas with a quick right uppercut, and landed more combinations as the round ended. In the 5th, after a brief clinch between the two, they separated and Broner landed a hard left body shot on Rees, dropping Rees to a knee. Broner ended the round teeing off on Rees, with Rees' trainer throwing in the towel from the corner. CompuBox had Broner landing 48% of his punches in the fight, as well as ending the fight landing 40 of 57 in the final round.

===Welterweight===
====Broner vs. Malignaggi====
After failing to secure a fight with fellow Lightweight champion Ricky Burns, Broner decided to move up two weight classes to Welterweight in order to fight two division champion [[Paulie Malignaggi]]. Malignaggi was the WBA Welterweight Champion and ''Ring'' No. 6 ranked Welterweight. Bad blood brewed from the outset, with Broner making insults toward Malignaggi, and even going as far as to claim he had "Taken Paulie's girl." On fight night, Malignaggi was quicker off the mark and won the early rounds decisively, but Broner began to fight back in the middle of the fight and started to show his physical class as a fighter, landing with sporadic, but powerful blows. The final rounds were very close, but Broner pulled out a victory in the fight via a controversial split decision, with one judge scoring the fight 115-113 for Malignaggi, and the other two scoring 117-111 and 115-113 for Broner, making him a 3 weight world champion at just 23 years of age. It was later said by Malignaggi that the 117-111 score must have been a product of the "more politically connected fighter getting the decision." In social media outlets such as Twitter and Facebook, fans poured out their support for Malignaggi, and their belief that Adrien Broner was gifted the victory by a judge who was under the control of the promoter, Al Haymon.
