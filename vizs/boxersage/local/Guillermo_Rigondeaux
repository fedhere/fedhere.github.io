'''Guillermo Rigondeaux Ortiz''' ({{IPA-es|ɡiˈʎermo riɣonˈdo}}; born September 30, 1980) is a [[Cuba]]n boxer who won the gold medal at the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] and [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in the [[bantamweight]] (54&nbsp;kg) division. He is a seven-time (2000–06) Cuban national champion at bantamweight, and currently claims an [[amateur boxing|amateur]] record of nearly 475 fights with twelve losses; the last of these losses being to Rencise Perez and [[Bekzat Sattarkhanov]] in 1998, Waldemar Font in 1999, and most recently against [[Aghasi Mammadov]] in 2003.

==Defection==
On July 22, 2007, Rigondeaux and teammate [[Erislandy Lara]] failed to appear for their scheduled bouts at the Pan American Games in Brazil. It was initially announced that Rigondeaux was to turn professional, joining fellow 2004 Cuban Olympians [[Odlanier Solis]], [[Yuriorkis Gamboa]] and [[Yan Barthelemy]], who defected earlier in 2007. As with the other Cuban defectors, Rigondeaux signed a promotional deal with Ahmet Oener and ARENA Box-Promotion. However on August 2, Rigondeaux and Lara were taken into police custody in Brazil, stating that they wanted to return home to Cuba. Then Cuban leader Fidel Castro has stated that Rigondeaux and Lara will not box again for the Cuban team. In February 2009, Rigondeaux defected again via Mexico City to [[Miami]], and signed with Arena Box-Promotion.

==Professional career==

===Super Bantamweight===
On February 23, 2009, Rigondeaux was announced to have defected along with 2004 Olympic Silver Medalist [[Yudel Johnson]], [[Yordanis Despaigne]] and Yuniel Dorticos<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/1321/story/918151.html Miami Herald]</ref> and is now in Miami and is managed by Irish man Gary Hyde.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/olympicsNews/idUSN2334997020090223 Cuban Olympic champion boxer defects-promoter] Reuters</ref> He will be training in the same gym as [[Yuriorkis Gamboa]], [[Erislandi Lara]] and [[Odlanier Solis]].<ref>[http://www.fightnews.com/?p=4564 Boxing – Rigondeaux defects, in Miami!] Fightnews.com</ref> and will continue his career as a professional once he completes all the residency requirements.<ref>[http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=328333&CategoryId=13002 Latin American Herald Tribune – Cuban Boxer Defects]</ref> He left behind his wife Farah Colina, a 7 year old son and a 17 year old stepson in Cuba.<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gU56hJ6VtrMVtDamWClX4pkhq5XQD96I6OFO0 Associated Press]</ref> He is also reportedly staying in the home of countryman and featherweight contender Yuriorkis Gamboa.<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/story/918241.html MiamiHerald.com]</ref>

Rigondeaux won his professional debut on May 22 with a third-round TKO over Juan Noriega in Miami.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/blog/121113|title=Rigondeaux cruises in pro debut|date=May 22, 2009|publisher=''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]''|accessdate=May 19, 2013}}</ref> Although he did not maintain a busy punch volume, Rigondeaux still landed hard shots. Noriega barely countered Rigondeaux's punches and the referee found the opportunity to stop the fight after Rigondeaux connected with a solid right to the head. On July 17 he won his second pro fight against Robert Guillen by first round knock out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.15rounds.com/rigondeaux-stops-guillen-in-one-071709/|author=Marc Abrams|title=Vazquez upsets Prescott in Vegas|date=July 18, 2009|publisher=15rounds.com|accessdate=May 19, 2013}}</ref> Rigondeaux wasn't active but he hit Guillen with a great hard counter punch to the body which left him rolling on the canvas in pain.

On September 18, Rigondeaux beat Giovanni Andrade by 3rd round TKO to win the [[NABA]] Super Bantamweight title, dropping Andrade once in each of rounds two and three.

On December 16, 2009 Rigondeaux won a Unanimous Decision over Lante Addy in 8 rounds, dropping Addy once in round one.

On February 5, 2010, Rigondeaux scored a 1st round Knockout against Adolfo Landeros, dropping Landeros with a hard left uppercut to the body.

Rigondeaux then signed a three-year contract with [[Bob Arum]]'s [[Top Rank]] in July 2010.<ref name="espn201007">{{Cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=5395544|title=Rigondeaux's new deal a really big deal|author=Dan Rafael|date=July 20, 2010|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}</ref> He is also co-promoted by Boris Arencibia's Caribe Promotions.<ref name="boxingscene201204">{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&opt=printable&id=52207|title=Photos: Rigondeaux Starts Sparring With Hairon Socarras|author=Reynaldo Sanchez|date=April 26, 2012|publisher=BoxingScene.com|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}</ref>

The [[Ricardo Cordoba]] fight was on the [[HBO]] televised undercard of the [[Manny Pacquiao vs. Antonio Margarito]] [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[Light Middleweight]] title fight at Cowboys Stadium, Dallas, in front of 70,000 people. This was the biggest fight in Rigondeaux's career to date. Rigondeaux knocked Cordoba down in the 4th with a body shot, but was judged to be knocked down in turn in the 6th, in what appeared to be a slip. Despite appearing to win clearly, the fight was judged a split decision, with Rigondeaux the victor and becoming a world champion in his 8th bout (though [[interim]]) winning the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] [[Super Bantamweight]] title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=5802278|title=Guillermo Rigondeaux slips by in bout|work=ESPN}}</ref>

The fight against [[Willie Casey]] was live on RTE (Ireland) at the City West Convention Centre, Dublin, Ireland on the 19th of March 2011. This was Rigondeaux's first defense of his WBA Interim Title. A sweeping left uppercut in the opening round caught Casey flush and sent him back on his rear causing his glove to touch the mat at 1:45. He was up immediately and received a mandatory eight-count. A combination capped with a left hook sent Casey falling across the ring and down at 2:19. He was able to make it to his feet but was visibly wobbled. A follow-up barrage sent Casey stumbling forward. At that, the referee stepped in and waved an end to the bout.

====Rigondeaux vs. Ramos====
[[File:Guillermo Rigondeaux vs. Rico Ramos - 20JAN2012 Las Vegas - Palms Casino.jpg|thumb|Rigondeaux knocking down Ramos in the 1st round]]
Rigondeaux won the "full" WBA World Super Bantamweight title by knocking out champion and ''Ring'' No. 2 ranked Super Bantamweight [[Rico Ramos]] in the 6th round. Rigondeaux controlled the opening round against a tentative Ramos. He quickly moved into range and fired the left hand both to the body and upstairs. A straight left hand caught Ramos against the ropes and sent him down at 2:24 of the opening round. He was up quickly and received a mandatory eight-count. Rigondeaux attacked but Ramos gathered himself and finished the round. Output waned in the 2nd and 3rd Rounds both fighters looked for countering opportunities with neither seeming overly willing to open up. An accidental clash of heads opened a small cut on the outside of Ramos's left eyebrow near the end of Round 4. Rigondeaux was warned in Round 6 for pulling down the back of Ramos's head. Immediately after the warning, Rigondeaux came forward with a barrage and landed a clean left hand to the body that sent Ramos to the mat grimacing in pain. He remained down on his back as the referee reached the count of ten.

Rigondeaux has been trained under Ismael Salas<ref name="boxingscene201201">{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&opt=printable&id=48322|title=Rigondeaux: After Ramos, We Want The Division's Best|author=Reynaldo Sanchez|date=January 10, 2012|publisher=BoxingScene.com|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}</ref> after working with Freddie Roach, Alejandro "Pupi" Torre and [[Ronnie Shields]],<ref name="espn201007" /> and has worked out with [[Jorge Rubio (boxing trainer)|Jorge Rubio]] at his Xtreme Gym in [[Hialeah, Florida]] for [[Teon Kennedy]] fight.<ref name="boxingscene201204" /> DJ Montanocordoba has served as his physical conditioner.<ref name="boxingscene201201" />

Despite Rigondeaux and his camp's great efforts to make a fight with any of the other 122 pound champions, they have been dodged by the other champions such as [[Nonito Donaire]], [[Toshiaki Nishioka]], [[Jeffrey Mathebula]] and [[Abner Mares]].<ref name="elnuevoherald">{{Cite web|url=http://www.elnuevoherald.com/2012/06/08/1224076/por-un-triunfo-fulminante.html|title=Por un triunfo fulminante|author=Jorge Ebro|date=June 8, 2012|publisher=''[[El Nuevo Herald]]''|language=Spanish|accessdate=June 11, 2012}}</ref> Rigondeaux told "They are cowards".

Rigondeaux knew the split decision victory against Ricardo Cordoba did not please the HBO people, and learned from it the importance of aggressiveness. From the standpoint of promotion, the second appearance on HBO was crucial to him. He did not want to make the same mistake as he did two years ago.<ref name="elnuevoherald" /> Rigondeaux impressively stopped Kennedy in the 5th round after knocking him down five times all with his left cross,<ref name="ring20120610">{{Cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/blog/173257|title=Rigondeaux scores five knockdowns in sensational KO win|author=Lem Satterfield|date=June 10, 2012|publisher=''The Ring''|accessdate=June 11, 2012}}</ref> leading Kennedy to say "He just hits you with punches that you can't see".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mma-boxing.si.com/2012/06/09/manny-pacquiao-timothy-bradley-undercard-results/|title=Manny Pacquiao-Timothy Bradley undercard results|author=Bryan Armen Graham|date=June 10, 2012|publisher=''[[Sports Illustrated]]''|accessdate=June 11, 2012}}</ref> He has differentiated from the Cordoba fight.

He fought against [[Roberto Marroquin]] on the undercard of the [[Sergio Martínez (boxer)|Sergio Martínez]] vs. [[Julio César Chávez, Jr.]] at the [[Thomas & Mack Center]] on September 15, 2012. It was a relatively easy night for Rigondeaux, who outworked and outlanded Marroquin and seemed to just cruise through the fight. Rigondeaux gave his young opponent the first knockdown of his career in the 5th round and scored another knockdown in the 12th round. The judges scored the bout:118-108, 118-108 and 118-109, all three in favour of Rigondeaux who retained his WBA title by unanimous decision.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/8382599|title=Rigondeaux cruises vs. Marroquin|author=Dan Rafael|date=September 16, 2012|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=September 16, 2012}}</ref>

====Rigondeaux vs. Donaire====
Rigondeaux fought [[Nonito Donaire]] at [[Radio City Music Hall]] on April 13, 2013 to defend his WBA title and for Donaire's WBO and ''The Ring'' titles. Rigondeaux has left his trainer Jorge Rubio in order to start training with his former amateur trainer Pedro Diaz for this fight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/boxing/news/article/543/8633181/donaire-too-classy-for-cuban|title=Donaire too classy for Cuban|author=Derek Bilton|date=April 12, 2013|publisher=''[[Sporting Life (British newspaper)|Sporting Life]]''|accessdate=April 14, 2013}}</ref> Donaire came into the fight as the pound-for-pound No. 5 fighter in the world.<ref name="hbo201304">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/boxing/fights/2013/04-13-nonito-donaire-vs-guillermo-rigondeaux/article/donaire-rigondeaux-fight-recap.html|title=Nonito Donaire vs. Guillermo Rigondeaux Fight Recap|author=Eric Raskin|date=April 14, 2013|publisher=[[HBO]]|accessdate=April 14, 2013}}</ref>

Rigondeaux defeated Donaire by unanimous decision with the scores of 114–113, 115–112, and 116–111, though the fight was considered much wider than the judges scorecards indicated.<ref name="hbo201304" /> Rigondeaux frustrated Donaire early and often with his quick lead right hook, and left hand. Rigondeaux would continue to land the cleaner punches and dip out of range from Donaire for the first nine rounds of the fight. In the 10th round, while Rigondeaux attempted to clinch with Donaire, he was pushed off and caught with a straight left hand from Donaire, sending him to the canvas. Rigondeaux appeared to hurt Donaire with a straight left early in the 12th round, when Donaire covered up a severely swollen right eye and began bleeding from his mouth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/sports/Guillermo_Rigondeaux_wins_122-pound_unification_fight_at_Radio_City_Music_Hall.html?c=y&page=1|title=Guillermo Rigondeaux wins 122-pound unification fight at Radio City Music Hall|author= Keith Idec|date=April 14, 2013|publisher=''The Record''|accessdate=April 14, 2013}}</ref> Rigondeaux ended the round and fight targeting Donaire with his left hand, backing Donaire up.
