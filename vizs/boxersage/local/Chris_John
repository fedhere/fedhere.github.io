===Chris John vs. Oscar Leon===

2003 was a milestone in Chris's boxing career. Following the win over Dae-Kyun Park, Chris captured the PABA Featherweight title from the .In one of the more definitive and memorable fights of his career, John was given the opportunity to fight hard-hitting  [[Oscar León]] of Colombia for the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] featherweight title on 26 September 2003 in Bali. john was The Ring's #8-ranked  featherweight in the world (and #10 pound-for-pound), while Oscar was the #5-ranked featherweight in the world and #5 pound-for-pound. This was Oscar's second title fight in his career. His first, losing to then WBA featherweight champion [[Derrick Gainer]] in a very disputed twelve round split-decisions.

===Chris John vs. Derrick Gainer===

In 2005, John split with trainer Sutan Rambing prior to [[Derrick Gainer]] Fight. Preparing for this bout Chris joined Harry's Gym in Perth, Australia, where he is currently trained and managed by Craig Christian.

Five months after the fight with Oscar, Chris went on to defend his WBA title to former champion Derrick Gainer. Heading to the bout, Derrick was favourite to take the title he lost 2 years ago to Lineal Champion Juan Manuel Marquez. A lot was in stake for both fighters heading into the bout. Gainer's status as a featherweight upper echelon was in jeopardy and Chris was out there to prove that his previous win was not a fluke.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2005/04/22/chris-john-out-prove-himself-gainer-bout.html |title=

Despite scoring a first round knockdown, Derrick Gainer's attempt to once again win a world featherweight title failed at the Britama Arena Sport Hall in Jakarta, Indonesia. Derrick was outclassed in this fight largely due to Chris’s counterpunch style, which he managed to effectively utilize against Derrick Style.  Chris won the match decisively by 12 round unanimous decision(118-109, 118-111, and 118-110).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://secondsout.com/world-boxing-news?ccs=225&cs=16137 |title=

===Chris John vs. Juan Manuel Marquez===
In the year of 2006,[[Quadruple Champion]] [[Juan Manuel Márquez]] challenged Chris for his WBA featherweight Championship. Coming into the bout, Marquez fought to a draw against P4P fighter Manny Pacquiao. 

Chris controlled the fight by his hard jabs and counter punching skills. The  Dragon was boxing smartly; jabbing and double jabbing, staying away from the power of Marquez. The corner of Marquez implored him to “get going, work, work,” but he was unable to slow John down.The undefeated fighter came out on top winning through unanimous decision(116-112, 116-110 and 117-111.)This was rank first in the greatest upset of 2006. The loss led to the Ring Magazine's removal of Márquez from its pound-for-pound top 10 list and John's first every entry into the list. The decision was not received nicely by Marquez camp and accused Chris John of bribing the judges. However, most boxing analyst scored this fight in favor of Chris John.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fightreport.net/?p=485|date=December 10, 2012 |title=Chris vs John 2006}}</ref> Marquez and his team have always disputed the (2006) decision, even though all three judges gave it to Chris. 

In 2012, following Marquez's upset win over Pacquiao, Chris John called him out for a second bout to be staged in Singapore or Macau in a neutral ground. "I am a much better boxer than him (Marquez) and I have more speed and skill," said John. "I will fight Marquez at any weight because it is a big money fight," John,told the Straits Times. Australian promoter Angelo Hyder said he would propose a fight at lightweight, meaning the Mexican would have to shed weight and John would have to gain about four kilograms (nine pounds).
