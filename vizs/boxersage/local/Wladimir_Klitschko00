'''Wladimir Klitschko'''<ref>'''Wladimir Klitschko''' is a [[German language|German]] transliteration of {{lang-rus|Владимир Владимирович Кличко|r=Vladimir Vladimirovič Kličko|p=vlɐˈdʲimʲɪr klʲɪt͡ɕˈko}}, equivalent [[English language|English]] spelling is '''Vladimir Klichko''', {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|l|æ|d|ɨ|m|ɪər|_|ˈ|k|l|ɪ|tʃ|k|oʊ}}; {{lang-uk|Володимир Володимирович Кличко}}, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|tr.]]{{transl|uk|Latn|''Volodymyr Volodymyrovyč Klyčko''}}, IPA: {{IPA-uk|ʋɔlɔˈdɪmɪr klɪt͡ʃˈkɔ|}}</ref> ({{lang-uk|Володи́мир Володи́мирович Кличко́}} [''Volodymyr Volodymyrovych Klychko'']; born 25 March 1976) is a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[heavyweight]] professional [[Boxing|boxer]]. Klitschko is the [[World Boxing Association|WBA (Super)]], [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]], [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]], [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] and ''[[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'']]'' [[Heavyweight]] Champion. His older brother [[Vitali Klitschko]] is the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Heavyweight Champion as of 2013. Klitschko is the longest reigning IBF, WBO & IBO Heavyweight Champion in history with the most title defenses for those organizations. Overall, he is the [[Longest reigning heavyweight champions|3rd longest reigning Heavyweight Champion of all time]] with the 3rd most consecutive title defenses at 14. As of December 2012, ''[[Boxrec]]'' rates Klitschko as the number 3 pound-for-pound in the world. ''[[Ring Magazine]]'' currently rates Klitschko as the number four [[Ring Magazine pound for pound|pound-for-pound]] boxer in the world.

Since 2005, Klitschko has been the dominant force in the heavyweight division, defeating a majority of the top heavyweights in the rankings. When Klitschko won the IBF title against [[Chris Byrd]] there were four separate Heavyweight Champions. Since then, he has unified the IBF, IBO, WBO & WBA belts and defeated the WBA Champion in recess. Following his win over [[Ruslan Chagaev]], Klitschko was awarded the vacant Ring Magazine Heavyweight title.

== Early life ==
Klitschko was born in [[Semey|Semipalatinsk]], [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]] (now Semey, [[Kazakhstan]]).<ref name=boxrec>[http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=7035&cat=boxer Wladimir Klitschko]. Boxrec.com. Retrieved on 1 May 2013.</ref><ref>Vester, Mark. [http://www.boxingscene.com/wladimir-klitschko-fan-borat--6348 "Wladimir Klitschko A Fan of Borat"], BoxingScene.com, 22 November 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.tour2kiev.com/en/Klitschko.html "Vitali & Wladimir Klitschko"], Tour2Kiev.com, n.d.</ref> Their father, Vladimir Rodionovich Klitschko (1947–2011), was a [[Soviet Air Force]] [[major general]] and a [[military attaché]] of Ukraine in Germany. He was also one of the commanders in charge of cleaning up the effects of the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986 and was afterward diagnosed with cancer. Their mother is Nadezhda Ulyanovna.<ref>[http://kp.ua/daily/130711/290155/ У братьев Кличко умер отец]. Komsomolskaya Pravda (in Russian) 13 July 2011</ref>

In the summer of 1996, Klitschko finished Pereyaslav-Khmelnitsky Pedagogical Institute (Ukraine) and was accepted in the postgraduate study program of [[Kiev University]]. On 18 January 2001, in a conference hall of Kyiv University of physical science and sports, Klitschko presented his doctoral dissertation and was awarded a PhD in [[Sports Science]]. Klitschko speaks four languages: [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], Russian, German and English. At the beginning of his professional career, he began using the German transliteration of his name, ''Wladimir''.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

== Amateur career ==
In the early 1990s, Klitschko was coached in [[Poland]]'s Gwardia Warszawa boxing club, where, according to [[Jerzy Kulej]], "He and his brother used to demolish our boys."<ref>["Kliczko już w Polsce nokautował" http://www.tvn24.pl/sport,4/kliczko-juz-w-polsce-nokautowal-wyrywal-naszych-z-korzeniami,158132.html], TVN24, 7 January 2011</ref> In 1993, Klitschko won the Junior European Championships as a [[heavyweight]]. In 1994, he received 2nd place at the Junior World Championships in [[Istanbul, Turkey]]. In 1995, he won the gold medal at the Military Championships in [[Ariccia]], [[Italy]], defeating [[Luan Krasniqi]], who he had lost to in the third round of the World Championships in [[Berlin, Germany]] earlier that year. In 1996, he captured 2nd place as a Super Heavyweight at the European Championships in [[Vejle, Denmark]]. He had an amateur record of 134–6.

Known as "The Steel Hammer," Klitschko first achieved world attention at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]], Georgia. He defeated [[Paea Wolfgramm]] to win the [[Olympic medalists in boxing|Super-Heavyweight gold medal]]. He is now announced as "Dr. Steel Hammer," a name more in the vein of his brother, Vitali, who goes by "Dr. Ironfist."

== Professional career ==
Klitschko turned professional with Universum Box-Promotion in Hamburg under the tutelage of [[Fritz Sdunek]].

After building an undefeated record of 24–0, he suffered his first loss to journeyman [[Ross Puritty]], who entered the bout with a record of 24–13–1. Wladimir Klitschko's coach, Fritz Sdunek, jumped into the ring and stopped the fight.

On 18 March 2000, Wladimir fought [[Paea Wolfgramm]], whom he fought previously in the 1996 Super Heavyweight Olympic Finals. In their professional rematch, Klitschko knocked Wolfgramm out in the first round.

=== Klitschko vs. Byrd & title defenses ===
On 14 October 2000, in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]]'s [[Kölnarena]], Klitschko won the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] Heavyweight Championship from American [[Chris Byrd]] by a wide unanimous decision by scores of: 120–106, 119–107 & 118–108, flooring his opponent twice. Byrd had previously upset his elder brother Vitali (who pulled out injured during their bout).

Klitschko registered five successful title defenses, all by TKO over: [[Derrick Jefferson]], [[Charles Shufford]], [[Frans Botha]], former WBO champion [[Ray Mercer]] & [[Jameel McCline]].

=== Klitschko vs. Sanders & Brewster ===
Klitschko suffered an upset TKO loss to [[Corrie Sanders]] on March 8, 2003 in [[Hannover]], Germany. Sanders dropped Klitschko twice in the opening round and scored two more knockdowns in the second round before the bout was stopped by the official. The fight was  named The Ring magazine Upset of the Year for 2003.

After winning two minor bouts in Germany and enlisting the services of legendary boxing trainer [[Emanuel Steward]], Klitschko again fought for the vacated WBO title on 10 April 2004, in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], against [[Lamon Brewster]]. Klitschko sent Brewster to the canvas in the fourth round; however, things turned around in the fifth when Brewster's punches began backing him up. Not defending himself and leaning into ropes for support, Klitschko took a standing eight count. On unsteady legs, both fighters fell to the canvas after the bell and the referee stopped the fight for his safety.

=== Klitschko vs. Williamson, Castillo & Peter ===
Following his loss to Brewster, Klitschko began his journey back towards the top of the heavyweight division. First, he defeated [[DaVarryl Williamson]] by technical decision. The fight was stopped due to a Klitschko cut caused by an accidental headbutt. He then knocked out undefeated Cuban contender [[Eliseo Castillo]].

Klitschko then signed to fight undefeated power puncher [[Samuel Peter]] in an IBF & WBO eliminator. The much anticipated bout proved to be hugely entertaining. It went some way towards redeeming Klitschko in the heavyweight division. Though Peter scored three knockdowns (two in round 5, one in round 10) Klitschko withstood the Nigerian's power and went on to outbox Peter for a majority of the rounds.

=== Klitschko vs. Byrd II, Brock & Austin ===
On 22 April 2006, in [[Mannheim]], Germany, Klitschko defeated Chris Byrd for a second time, this time by technical knockout, in a contest for the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] & [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] Heavyweight Championships. [[Referee (boxing)|Referee]] Wayne Kelly stopped the fight in the seventh round after a knockdown—Byrd beat the count, but his face was battered and bloody, and the fight was waved off. 

He returned in November, facing the arguably the fastest rising contender, undefeated [[Calvin Brock]] at [[Madison Square Garden]], Wladimir had difficulties reaching the awkward Brock. After four rounds Harold Lederman had it even at 38–38. However, from fifth round onward, Klitschko became more active and his jab became a factor and Brock became more flat-footed, leaving him easier to hit. Brock was floored in the seventh round, although he barely beat the count, Referee Kelly felt he was in no condition to continue.

Klitschko then defeated mandatory challenger [[Ray Austin (boxer)|Ray Austin]] on 10 March 2007, at the [[SAP Arena]] in Mannheim, Germany by a second-round [[knockout]] with four consecutive left hooks to Austin's head. Klitschko did not use his right hand once during the fight, doing all his work with his left [[jab]] and left [[Hook (boxing)|hook]]. 

=== Klitschko vs. Brewster II, Ibragimov &Thompson ===
Klitschko then avenged one of his previous losses as he defeated Lamon Brewster on 7 July 2007, in Cologne, Germany. Brewster's [[Cornermen|corner]] asked the referee to stop the fight at the end of the sixth round. It was later revealed that Klitschko fought most of the fight with a broken middle finger on his left hand.

Klitschko defeated WBO Heavyweight Champion [[Sultan Ibragimov]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] on 23 February 2008 to unify the IBF, IBO & WBO Heavyweight titles. The Klitschko-Ibragimov fight was the first heavyweight unification since Holyfield-Lewis in 1999. The unification clash with Ibragimov proved to be a huge disappointment for fans. Klitschko was very dominant from the first bell. He backed Ibragimov into a corner and proceeded to push down Ibragimov's glove with his left hand so he could not throw a punch. Though Klitschko won every single round the crowd in [[New York]] began booing after the second round. The boos and jeers increased as the fight progressed in the same fashion. Ibragimov's corner was almost silent from the sixth round onwards unable to give their man any meaningful advice.

On 12 July 2008, at the [[Color Line Arena]] in Hamburg, Klitschko faced mandatory challenger [[Tony Thompson (boxer)|Tony Thompson]], in a good action fight. Klitschko controlled the fight with his jab and right hand; Thompson had his moments but was outworked and out skilled for the majority of the rounds, he floored Thompson with a right hand in the 11th round and Thompson didn't beat the count.

[[File:Wladimir Klitschko (2008-12-13).jpg|thumb|left|Wladimir Klitschko boxing Hasim Rahman, 2008|203x203px]]

=== Klitschko vs.  Rahman, Chagaev & Chambers===
Klitschko was scheduled to defend his titles against [[Alexander Povetkin]] later in 2008,<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=3591004 Klitschko's company wins purse bid for 13 December fight]. Sports.espn.go.com (16 September 2008). Retrieved on 25 November 2011.</ref> but on 25 October, Povetkin withdrew from the fight due to an ankle injury. Instead, Klitschko faced [[Hasim Rahman]] on 13 December 2008 and won by TKO. This was the third time Klitschko fought at the [[SAP Arena]] in [[Mannheim]], Germany. He dominated the fight, winning every round while making good use of his left jab. From the first bell the difference in physical strength was profound. Rah

man seemed unable to withstand Klitschko's punch power. The referee finally called a stop to the one-sided contest in the 7th round after Rahman failed to respond to a series of good shots.

Klitschko was scheduled to face [[David Haye]], who pulled out within weeks of the fight complaining of a back injury. Salvaging the 20 June 2009 date and venue, Klitschko instead retained the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]], [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] and [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] Heavyweight titles and also won the vacant [[Ring Magazine]] heavyweight title by defeating replacement opponent and Ring No. 3 ranked [[Ruslan Chagaev]] when Chagaev retired after an onslaught of punches towards the end of the ninth round. As Chagaev was [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Champion, the title was not on the line. Klitschko's win over Chagaev was seen as one of his most impressive performances in the ring. He controlled the tempo of the fight from the very beginning and hit Chagaev at will with the jab. He hit Chagaev with several hard right crosses and never allowed him to build momentum. Towards the end of the second round Klitschko caught Chagaev off balance and sent him to the canvas. Chagaev recovered but was dominated thereafter. This win had added significance because even though the WBA title was not on the line, many saw Klitschko as the rightful champion.

On 9 December 2009, Klitschko's management group, K2 Promotions confirmed that a bout with [[Eddie Chambers]] has been agreed to take place in Germany on 20 March 2010. This mandatory title defense, originally scheduled for December 2009 had to be delayed due to a hand injury that Klitschko sustained in training that required surgery.

Klitschko defeated Chambers by knockout five seconds before the end of the final round.<ref>{{cite news

Klitschko began punching more often during the final round than he had done before which eventually led to his left hook hitting Chambers to the forehead. The punch made Chambers fall forwards and lost consciousness for an extended period of time. The referee stepped in and called an end to the contest instantly.

=== Klitschko vs. Peter II & Haye ===
[[File:Wladimir Klitschko 2010.jpg|thumb|Klitschko in [[Hollenstedt]], Lower Saxony, Germany, on 21 May 2010.|256x256px]]
Following the match with Chambers, a unification fight between Klitschko and [[David Haye]], who as of May 2009 held the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] title, appeared to be in the offing.  Klitschko called out the Briton on YouTube in April 2010, stating, "I want to send this message to boxing fans and directly to David Haye. David, you've bitched out on fighting both Klitschko brothers twice already and now's the time to make it happen. On behalf of the boxing fans around the world, I am officially calling you out to fight me. You can't run away from me forever and you need to follow through with this fight if you want to be respected. I'm ready.

Samuel Peter replaced Povetkin for the scheduled fight. Klitschko faced Peter for a second time, as they had fought in 2005 previously. Peter fought Klitschko on 11 September 2010, for the Ukrainian's IBF, WBO & IBO Heavyweight titles. Klitschko won again, by knocking out Peter in the 10th round.<ref>{{cite web|title =Klitschko vs Peter Details; Bowman vs Acevado Tops |publisher =BoxingScene.com |date =30 July 2010 |url =http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&id=29686 |accessdate =31 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last =Kim |first =Jason |title =Samuel Peter signs contract for fight against Vladimir Klitschko |publisher =BoxingNews24.com |date =29 July 2010 |url =http://www.boxingnews24.com/2010/07/samuel-peter-signs-contract-for-fight-against-vladimir-klitschko/ |accessdate =31 July 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last =Sukachev |first =Alexey |title =Klitschko Batters Peter For Ten Rounds, Knockout Win |publisher =BoxingScene.com |date =11 September 2010 |url =http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&id=30863 |accessdate =12 September 2010}}</ref> Peter weighed in at 241 pounds, two pounds lighter than their first fight. Klitschko came in at a career heavy of 247 pounds. Both fighters had promised knockouts in the pre-fight build up. Peter started the fight very aggressively and caught Klitschko with a good left hook in the opening minute although Klitschko ended the round well. Peter was caught with three hard right-hands in the second round, one of which seemed to stun him. Peter tried to duck under the Klitschko jab, but was being tied up on the inside. After four rounds the fight became one-sided in Klitschko's favour. Peter's right eye was closing and he was taking heavy punishment. After the ninth round, Peter's trainer Abel Sanchez said he would give him one more round. Emmanuel Steward also implored Klitschko to be more aggressive. Peter swung wildly in the tenth and Klitschko put him down with a concussive combination. Referee Robert Byrd did not start a count and waved the fight off, awarding Klitschko the win by knockout. Klitschko however was set to fight [[Dereck Chisora]] on 11 December, but the fight was later called off on 8 December due to Klitschko tearing a muscle in his abdomen.<ref>{{cite news|author=Chris Mannix, SI.com|date=8 December 2010|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/mma/boxing/12/08/klitschko.chisora.canceled/index.html|title=Klitschko tears adbominal muscle, pulls out of Saturday title defense|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated|SI.com]]|accessdate=9 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Dan Rafael|date=9 December 2010|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=5900377|title=Wladimir Klitschko withdraws from fight|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=9 December 2010}}</ref>{{Main|Wladimir Klitschko vs. David Haye}}
