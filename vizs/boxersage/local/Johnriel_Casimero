===Return to Light Flyweight Division===

Casimero escaped by going under the boxing ring to protect himself from the angered fans. 

Casimero, and members of his team were kicked and assaulted when fans in Mar Del Plata hurled chairs and stormed the ring following his 10th-round knockout of local Argentine fighter [[Luis Alberto Lazarte]] in the IBF junior flyweight championship.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/mma/boxing/02/15/boxer.attacked.ap/index.html Philippines protests attack on boxer in Argentina – SI.com – Boxing].

After the riot, police escorted Casimero and his team to their hotel and provided protection for them. [[Luis Alberto Lazarte|Alberto Lazarte]] later visited to apologize.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

On July 19, 2012, Casimero was declared as the regular IBF Junior Flyweight World Champion because of the inability of Ulises Solis to defend his title on or before October 30. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://philboxing.com/news/story-73234.html |date=20 July 2012 |title=IBF DECLARES CASIMERO NEW JUNIOR FLYWEIGHT CHAMPION |publisher=philboxing.com |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref>
