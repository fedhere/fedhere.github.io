'''Joseph Agbeko''' (born March 22, 1980 in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]]) is a [[Demographics of Ghana|Ghanaian]] professional [[Boxing|boxer]] with a record of 28-2 (22 KO). ''[[Ring Magazine|The Ring Magazine]]'' currently rates Agbeko at number ten in the bantamweight division.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ringtv.com/ratings/bantamweight/ |title=THE RING RATINGS, Bantamweight| publisher= The Ring|date=Feb. 18, 2013|accessdate=12 April 2013}}</ref>

== Professional career ==
On September 29, 2007, he dethroned [[Luis Alberto Perez]] to become the new [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[bantamweight]] titleholder. Agbeko was inactive for 1 year, 2 months and 11 days before defending his title on December 11, 2008. In a fight that had been repeatedly postponed, he defeated William Gonzalez by majority decision. On July 11, 2009, Agbeko successfully defended his IBF bantamweight title by scoring a unanimous decision win over former two division champion [[Vic Darchinyan]]. On [[Halloween]] night, October 31, 2009, Agbeko lost his IBF title by 12 round unanimous decision to 20-0 [[Colombia|Colombian]] challenger [[Yonnhy Pérez]].

On December 11, 2010, Agbeko was given the chance to regain his IBF title when he took on [[Yonnhy Pérez]] in the semi-finals of the [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] [[Bantamweight]] tournament, which was televised live from the [[Emerald Queen Casino]] in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Rather than brawling as he had done in his first fight with Pérez, Agbeko chose to use his boxing skills and stiff jab to cruise to a unanimous decision victory, with the judges scoring it 116-112, 117-111 and 115-113. Also on the card was [[Abner Mares]], who defeated [[Vic Darchinyan]] via controversial split-decision to advance to the finals and a showdown with Agbeko.<ref>{{cite web | last =LaBate| first =Chris| title =Joseph Agbeko Decisions Yonnhy Perez, Reclaims Title | work = | publisher =BoxingScene.com | date =December 11, 2011 | url =http://www.boxingscene.com/joseph-agbeko-decisions-yonnhy-perez-reclaims-title--33768 | accessdate =August 11, 2010}}</ref>

=== Agbeko vs. Mares ===
{{Main|Joseph Agbeko vs. Abner Mares}}
"King Kong" Agbeko was scheduled to take on [[Abner Mares]] in the Bantamweight Tournament Final: Winner Takes All on Saturday, April 23 on Showtime. However, Agbeko pulled out of the fight just days prior citing an injury. The fight has been rescheduled for August 13 in Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/2011-05-26-box-tournament_N.htm/ | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>

The fight ensued as scheduled on the 13th. However, the focal point of the fight became referee Russell Mora who repeatedly warned Mares for low blows without taking a point. To Agbeko's credit, despite many blows to the belt and below, he did not retaliate in kind.

Post fight Jim Gray continued Showtime's lambasting of Mora in an interview where he plainly showed the crucial call that turned the fight. A low blow in the 11th leading to a knockdown.

In all there were two knockdowns. The first coming early could have been called a slip but a punch was landed. The second was the result of what was definitely a low blow. It is possible that without the knockdown, Mares would not have won the fight. The scoring read 115-111, 115-111 and 113-113.
