'''Ricky Burns''' (born 13 April 1983) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] professional boxer from [[Coatbridge]], who fights in the [[lightweight]] division and is currently the [[WBO]] Lightweight champion. He is also a former WBO [[Super-Featherweight]] champion, [[Commonwealth super featherweight champion]] and has previously challenged for both the British and European titles. He is considered to be one of the "nice guys" of boxing and a superb role model.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ricky Burns is a credit to boxing – let's give him due respect|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/ricky-burns-is-a-credit-to-boxing---757177|publisher=mirror.co.uk|date=9 March 2012|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ricky Burns is British boxings best role model|url=http://www.fansshare.com/news/ricky-burns-is-british-boxings-best-role-model/|publisher=fanshare.com|date=9 March 2012|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ricky Burns: ‘When We Trade, I Guarantee I’ll Not Be The One Backing Off First!’|url=http://www.frankwarren.com/news/interviews/ricky-burns-when-we-trade-i-guarantee-i-ll-not-be-the-one-backing-off-first.html|publisher=frankwarren.com|date=19 September 2012|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ricky Hatton pays tribute to "top-drawer" Ricky Burns|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/scotland/20432617|publisher=bbc.co.uk|date=23 November 2012|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>

==Career==

===Early career===
Burns first fight as a professional was a four round victory in October 2001 over Woody Greenaway at the Thistle Hotel in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. On 12 December 2004, following a string of seven wins over opponents including Jeff Thomas, Ernie Smith and Daniel Thorpe he was matched against fellow unbeaten prospect Colin Bain. The fight, at the Marriott Hotel in Glasgow, resulted in a first career defeat for Bain as Burns won over the six round distance. For Burns, the win set him up for a journey south of the border to face the unbeaten British lightweight champion [[Graham Earl]] in a non-title fight. The fight with Earl took place at the Wembley Conference Center and Burns produced one of the upsets of the year when he scored a points victory to beat Earl over eight rounds.<ref>[http://www.scottishboxing.co.uk/archives/000280.html Scottish Boxing | Burns beats British Lightweight Champion at Wembley]</ref>

===Title fights===
The win against Earl meant he would land a shot at the big time when in February 2006, he took on reigning British, Commonwealth and European champion [[Alex Arthur]]. The fight took place in Edinburgh and ended in defeat for Burns, as Arthur retained on points. Burns who was still only a 12-fight novice at this stage took the fight to Arthur prompting the champion to heap praise on him; "Ricky Burns was in superb shape and he was up for the fight" said Arthur, "He's a brilliant boxer with a great future and he could be a world champion one day." Burns himself refused to be disappointed with the loss saying; "I don't count that as a loss. I'm just 22 and it was great experience for me".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/4720810.stm BBC Sport | Arthur beats Burns in bruising title defence]</ref>

Burns next had a crack at the British title almost exactly a year later when in February 2007, he met reigning champion [[Carl Johanneson]] at the Town Hall in [[Leeds]]. The fight ended once again in defeat with Burns losing a 12 round decision to the experienced champion. Johanneson intent on winning well before his home crowd hounded Burns throughout the fight and managed to knock Burns down three times.<ref>[http://www.scottishboxing.co.uk/?p=733 Scottish Boxing | Brave Burns loses on points to Johanneson]</ref>

===New challenges===
After the defeat to Johanneson, Burns took the decision to leave his old boxing club in a bid to seek a new challenge. Burns had worked with Rab Bannan at the Barn Boxing Club for over 14 years, but the Johanneson defeat prompted a need for a change of direction. On telling his former mentor the news Burns said; "It was a nightmare having to tell him. It was really sad because I’ve been with him for 14 years. All my boxing life really. It was really hard but we left on good terms and we shook hands and I’m sure our paths will cross again." Burns moved to the Dalmarnock gym in Glasgow, where he could train alongside the likes of [[Willie Limond]] and [[Kenny Anderson (boxer)|Kenny Anderson]].<ref>[http://www.acadvertiser.co.uk/coatbridge-airdrie-sport/lanarkshire-boxing/2007/05/24/ricky-bids-sad-farewell-to-the-barn-club-65864-19191620/ Airdrie & Coatbridge Observer | Burns leaves Barn club]</ref>

Since the fight with Johanneson, Burns won eight fights in a row. A ten round win over Romanian Gheorghe Ghiompirica at the Thistle Hotel in Glasgow gave him the lightly regarded British International Masters belt.<ref>[http://www.acadvertiser.co.uk/coatbridge-airdrie-sport/lanarkshire-boxing/2008/05/22/burns-too-hot-for-romanian-in-masters-bout-65864-20949572/ Airdrie & Coatbridge Observer | Burns too hot for Romanian]</ref> Burns also spent time sparring former opponent Alex Arthur in preparation for Arthur's WBO Super-Featherweight title defence against [[Nicky Cook]].<ref>[http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/boxing-news/2008/08/05/alex-arthur-ready-to-cook-up-a-storm-with-ricky-burns-sparring-86908-20684916/ Arthur ready to cook up a storm with sparring partner Burns]</ref>

===Commonwealth champion===
In September 2008, Burns was in line for a crack at the vacant Commonwealth title, a belt which had been given up by Londoner [[Kevin Mitchell (boxer)|Kevin Mitchell]]. The challenge took place at the [[York Hall]] in [[Bethnal Green]] and saw Burns outpoint the Ghanaian [[Osumana Akaba]] over 12 rounds.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/7639201.stm Burns claims Commonwealth Crown]</ref> The fight which was taken with only weeks notice after the original main event on the card was cancelled propelled Burns into the championship frame. Speaking of his future ambitions Burns said; "There is only one fight I want at the moment. That fight would be the current British champion [[Kevin Mitchell (boxer)|Kevin Mitchell]]. He recently has been injured, and won't be back until December so we'll have to see what happens".<ref>[http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=17421&more=1 Eastside boxing | Burns : there is only one fight I want at the moment]</ref>

Burns defended his crown at Glasgow's Kelvin Hall soon afterwards in November 2008, against another Ghanaian, [[Yakubu Amidu]]. The African fighter had a record of 16–1–1, with all his victories coming by way of stoppage. Burns however was too much and his superior fitness levels showed as the referee stopped the contest in the seventh round handing victory to the Scotsman.<ref>[http://www.britishboxing.net/news_4024-Burns-hunts-down-the-Yak.html Britishboxing.net | Burns hunts down the Yak]</ref> Burns second defence took place in March 2009, and saw Burns halt former British champion [[Michael Gomez]] in the seventh round.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/boxing/7967839.stm BBC Sport | Burns retains title against Gomez]</ref> On 20 June 2009, Burns made perhaps the toughest defence of his title yet with a hard fought 12 round win over Northern Ireland's [[Kevin O'Hara]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/8110528.stm BBC Sport | Burns overcomes O'Hara in Glasgow]</ref> with the assistance of the highly experienced trainer Billy Nelson and his Fighting Scots Gym in Stepps. Ricky became Billy's first world champion.

===Super featherweight World champion===
Burns success in the ring had elevated him to the number one ranking with the [[World Boxing Organization]]'s rankings. Burns' promoter [[Frank Warren (promoter)|Frank Warren]] tried to negotiate a match with the reigning champion [[Román Martínez (boxer)|Roman Martinez]]. The bout with the Puerto Rican champion had been subject to numerous delays with the fight scheduled for both [[Scotland]] and [[Puerto Rico]] at various intervals only for the fight never to materialise and for Martinez to make a voluntary defence of his title instead. The uncertainty for Burns meant that a proposed British title contest against [[Gary Sykes]] never happened with Sykes winning the title against Burns replacement [[Andy Morris (boxer)|Andy Morris]] and defending against the man Burns had defeated in his last Commonwealth title defence Kevin O'Hara.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/8720899.stm BBC Sport | Ricky Burns awaits title destiny]</ref> Finally after almost a year of frustration Burns re-entered the ring on 15 May 2010, on the undercard of Kevin Mitchell's world title shot against [[Michael Katsidis]] at the [[Boleyn Ground]]. Burns continued his winning streak and kept ticking over with an eight round win over journeyman and former foe [[Youssef Al Hamidi]]. Burns claimed after the fight that he hoped the fight with Román Martinez would materialise around July and that it would be in Glasgow.<ref>[http://www.acadvertiser.co.uk/coatbridge-airdrie-sport/lanarkshire-boxing/2010/05/19/ricky-burns-clinches-upton-park-win-65864-26470041/ Airdie and Coatbridge Advertiser | Burns clinches Upton Park win]</ref>

The WBO super-featherweight title showdown between Burns and [[Román Martínez (boxer)|Roman Martinez]] was eventually confirmed on 24 June 2010 and scheduled to take place at the Kelvin Hall, Glasgow on 4 September. Speaking at the announcement of the fight Burns said; "this has been dragging on a bit..it is the biggest fight of my career but I'm more than confident that I can beat him".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/8758847.stm BBC Sport | Ricky Burns secures title bout with Roman Martinez]</ref> Finally on 4 September, Burns entered the ring at Kelvin Hall to face the WBO's unbeaten reigning world champion Roman Martinez. Martinez had held the title for over a year winning it from Englishman [[Nicky Cook]] and defending twice against Colombian [[Feider Viloria]] and Argentinian [[Gonzalo Munguia]].<ref>[http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=93555&cat=boxer Boxrec | Roman Martinez professional record]</ref> Despite suffering a knockdown in the first round, Burns took the fight to the champion winning on all three judges scorecards 115–112, 115–112 and 115–113 to inflict a career first defeat on Martinez and finally winning the world title.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/8955013.stm BBC sport | Ricky Burns beats Martinez in Glasgow]</ref>

Speaking of the fight, Burns promoter Frank Warren said; "this was the best night I've ever had in Scotland and I've had some great shows with [[Scott Harrison (boxer)|Scott Harrison]] and Alex Arthur as well as bringing [[Nigel Benn]] and [[Frank Bruno]] up here." Describing the atmosphere at the Kelvin Hall as "electric" he went on to praise Burns, who in winning the title had become Scotland's 12th world champion, saying Scotland had a new "sporting hero" and that the win would lead to a renaissance in Scottish boxing. It also transpired that before the fight the manager of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Neil Lennon]] had called to wish Burns the best and sent him a Celtic strip signed by the whole of the first team as a good luck present.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxingandmma/7982854/Ricky-Burns-shows-true-courage-to-become-Scotlands-12th-world-champion.html The Telegraph | Ricky Burns shows true courage to become Scotlands 12th world champion]</ref>

====Title defences====
On 4 December 2010, Burns defended his title for the first time against [[Norway|Norwegian]] boxer [[Andreas Evensen]] who held the WBO inter-continental belt at featherweight. The fight, at the [[Braehead Arena]] in Glasgow, resulted in another unanimous points win for Burns with the Scotsman also scoring a knockdown in the first round.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/9256392.stm BBC Sport | Ricky Burns defeats Andreas Evensen to retain WBO crown]</ref> On 12 March 2011, Burns made his second defence again at the Braehead Arena. His opponent the [[Ghana]]ian boxer Joseph Laryea had won the WBO Inter-Continental title win a victory over Scotsman Paul Appleby on the same night that Burns beat Evenson. The fight was stopped in the 7th round after Laryea withdrew citing a broken knuckle with Burns ahead in the fight.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/9423397.stm BBC Sport | Super featherweight Ricky Burns retains WBO title]</ref> Burns' next defence was scheduled for 16 July 2011 and against former WBO Champion [[Nicky Cook]], in Liverpool's Echo Arena.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/13553979.stm BBC Sport | Ricky Burns set to defend WBO title against Cook]</ref> The fight resulted in a 93 second stoppage for Burns as Cook's corner threw in the towel following an injury to his back. After only six seconds a punch from Burns resulted in Cook receiving a count and complaining of back trouble. Cook was sent to the canvas twice more before his corner retired the boxer handing a third straight defence of the title to Burns who said that he would like to fight the South African boxer [[Mzonke Fana]] next.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/14175359.stm BBC Sport | Ricky Burns stops Nicky Cook in first round the retain WBO title]</ref>

Burns was next scheduled to meet mandatory challenger, and ''[[Boxrec]]'' No. 1 rated [[Super featherweight]], [[Adrien Broner]], but announced on 22 September 2011 that he would be relinquishing his [[World Boxing Organisation|WBO]] Super featherweight title and moving up to compete at lightweight. Burns said that the move up a weight division would ease the pressure of having to control his weight saying "the last couple of fights it was getting harder and harder for me to do it."<ref name="katsidis"/> Adrien Broner commented on the situation, saying, "You vacated the title talking about you couldn't make weight no more. But you just fought four times and defended this title," Broner further said, "But everyone knows boxing is a game where you can duck fighters... and I guess he felt like running away was best for his career."<ref>[http://www.boxingscene.com/adrien-broner-blasts-ricky-burns-hank-lundy-perez--44495 Boxingscene | Adrien Broner Blasts Ricky Burns]</ref>

===Move to Lightweight===
In his first fight at the weight it was announced that Burns would fight Australian [[Michael Katsidis]] in London for the WBO interim lightweight title. Speaking of the fight Burns said that it would definitely be the toughest of his career saying "I don't think they could have got me a harder fight if they tried, he's been in with the best of the weight, he's proved himself, obviously he's one of the best in the division and it's a great chance to get out there and show what I can do." On 5 November 2011, Burns took on Katsidis for the WBO interim lightweight championship and despite being the slight underdog went on to win the fight by unanimous decision.<ref name="katsidis">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/15128594.stm BBC Sport | Burns ready for toughest fight with Katsidis]</ref> After the fight Burns claimed to have "proved a lot of people wrong" as some people "thought Michael would walk all over me". Speaking of the fight he added "Michael didn't give me a minute, he kept coming forward but I'd prepared for that. I'm doing my job and that's the way I always look at it."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/15609565.stm BBC Sport | Ricky Burns beats Michael Katsidis to win Lightweight title]</ref>

On 26 January 2012, Burns was installed as [[WBO]] Lightweight champion after former champion [[Juan Manuel Márquez]] moved up a division to [[Welterweight]]. Ricky defended his [[WBO]] Lightweight title against [[Namibia]]n fighter [[Paulus Moses]]. He will have the homefield advantage with the fight being held in Braehead Arena, [[Glasgow]]. Burns said, “It's great news about the title but it's back to reality and training hard for what will be a tough title defence against Moses in my homecoming in Scotland. “For the last 10 years I’ve been grafting away in my career. But in the last couple of years it has really taken off with me beating Roman Martinez and then beating a great warrior like Katsidis to put me up there with the best in the world.” Ricky would go on to successfully defend his title via a unanimous points win, with Moses outboxed by Ricky, who was awarded victory 119–110,120–110,117–111 by the three judges.

===Kevin Mitchell===
In June 2012 it was confirmed after months of negotiations that Burns' next fight will be another defence of his WBO Lightweight title, against former WBO Inter-Continental Lightweight champion [[Kevin Mitchell (boxer)|Kevin Mitchell]] on 22 September 2012. In front of a sold out [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre]] Burns turned in a career best performance to defeat Mitchell via fourth-round TKO. Burns looked the much bigger man on fight night and seemed to recognise this adopting a more aggressive style, he was gaining control of the fight by the 4th round out boxing Mitchell he would go on to Knock Mitchell down twice in Round 4 in the last minute of round 4 and a further onslaught forced the referee to stop the fight. Burns not known as a puncher made a big statement in this fight that he may be the best 135 pounder in the world.

===Cancelled Fights===
On 15 December 2012, Burns was expected to defend his WBO Lightweight title against Liam Walsh at the ExCeL, London. Walsh was later involved in a car crash and had to pull out.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/boxing/20368295</ref> Walsh's replacement was revealed to be [[Jose Ocampo]].<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/boxing/20541530</ref> Ocampo however, had to pull out due to death of his trainer.<ref>http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/boxing/ricky-burns-lightweight-world-title-1485457</ref> then followed an announcement from Burns that he would not be competing in London on that date after not being able to find an opponent in time.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/boxing/20677692</ref> With promoter [[Frank Warren (promoter)|Frank Warren]] unable to secure an opponent for a rescheduled date of 26 January 2013, Burns declined the opportunity of an exhibition bout, deciding instead to take a long rest between fights.<ref>http://www1.skysports.com/boxing/news/12040/8386355/Ricky-Burns-WBO-title-defence-postponed-again</ref><ref>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-2259097/Ricky-Burns-pulled-Glasgow-fight-prepare-bigger-challenge.html#axzz2KbpB9A00</ref>

===Vazquez fight and Promotions change===
On 4 March 2013, the unification fight between Burns and [[Miguel Vazquez]] (which was originally scheduled for 16 March 2013) was postponed to 20 April 2013 because Vazquez was suffering from a viral infection. Burns was due to defend his [[World Boxing Organisation|WBO]] title while also challenging for [[Miguel Vazquez|Vazquez']] IBF title.<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/mar/04/ricky-burns-miguel-vazquez-warren-groves</ref> The Vazquez fight was also called off with Burns manager Alex Morrison telling [[The Scotsman]] "I doubt very much that fight was ever going to happen – leading to an announcement on 7 March 2013 that Burns had left Frank Warren's promotion stable.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/boxing/21703887</ref><ref>"http://www.scotsman.com/sport/boxing/ricky-burns-and-frank-warren-part-company-1-2823537</ref> On 11 March 2013 it was confirmed that Burns had joined Eddie Hearne's [[Matchroom Sport|Matchroom]] promotions and will fight for the first time under Matchroom on 11 May 2013, when he will face Puerto Rican Jose Gonzalez at the [[Commonwealth Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome|Emirates Arena]] in Glasgow, a fight that will be broadcast on [[Sky Sports]]
.<ref>http://www.matchroomboxing.com/news/ricky_burns_signs_with_matchroom_boxing.htm</ref><ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/boxing/21746310</ref> Burns won the fight in the ninth round after being outboxed in the first 6 rounds however the fight took a drastic change in round 7 where Burns was hurt before firing back in true championship style, Burns dominated rounds 8 & 9. Gonzalez refused to come out for the tenth round citing a damaged wrist for pulling out of the fight despite being 87-84 ahead on all 3 cards.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/boxing/22498775</ref>  Burns's promoter Eddie Hearn announced that Burns would fight again in September 2013 against Raymundo Beltran of Mexico at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre .<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/may/12/ricky-burns-jose-gonzalez</ref>
