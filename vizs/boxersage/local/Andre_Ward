== Professional career ==
{{BLP sources section|date=November 2012}}

=== Super middleweight ===
Ward made his pro debut on December 18, 2004 by scoring a second round [[Knockout|TKO]] over Chris Molina. Ward dropped Molina in the first round with a straight left cross to the chin that drove him into the ropes and down on the second strand. Ward, continued to dominate the action and dropped Molina for the second and final time with another sharp left hook to the jaw. The referee waved off the bout at 40 seconds of the second round.

On February 5, 2005 Ward fought in his second pro fight against Kenny Kost. Ward overcame a rocky second round, in which he was hurt by a left hook, to win by unanimous decision. Ward defeated Roy Ashworth on April 7, 2005 by disqualification, after Ashworth committed numerous fouls on Ward, including shoving Ward to the canvas and hitting him in the back of his head.

Ward won his next three fights, all by knockout, before going up against Darnell Boone on November 19, 2005. Ward was knocked down for the first time in his career in round four. Despite the knockdown, Ward went on to win by unanimous decision.

After the fight with Boone, Ward went on to win his next six fights, including TKO victories over undefeated [[Andy Kolle]] and Francisco Diaz. On November 16, 2007 Ward beat undefeated Roger Cantrell by fifth round TKO in [[Saint Lucia]].

On March 20, 2008, at the [[HP Pavilion at San Jose|HP Pavilion]] in [[San Jose, California]], Ward defeated [[Rubin Williams (boxer)|Rubin Williams]] by seventh round TKO. Ward hit Williams with jabs and straight left hands almost at will, opening a bad cut over Williams' left eye in the process. The cut would force the referee to stop the fight.

Ward faced [[Jerson Ravelo]] on June 20, 2008, in [[Georgetown, Cayman Islands]], for the vacant regional [[North American Boxing Organization|NABO]] [[super middleweight]] title. Ward dominated Ravelo for the majority of the fight en route to a TKO victory in the eighth round.

On May 16, 2009, at the [[Oracle Arena]] in [[Oakland, California]], Ward defeated [[Edison Miranda]] by unanimous decision. The scores were 116–112, 119–109, 119–109 for Ward. Ward showed he had an inside game as well as an outside game. Miranda couldn't stay up with Ward's versatility around the ring.

On September 12, 2009, at the [[Pechanga Resort and Casino]] in [[Temecula, California]], Ward defeated Shelby Pudwill by TKO in the 3rd round.

==== Super Six ====

===== Ward vs. Kessler =====
{{Main|Mikkel Kessler vs. Andre Ward}}
Andre Ward defeated [[Mikkel Kessler]] on November 21, 2009 for the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] [[List of super middleweight boxing champions|super middleweight championship]] in the [[Super Six World Boxing Classic]]. Kessler was the strong favorite going into Showtime's Super Six tournament. In a career-defining performance, undefeated hometown favorite Ward put the U.S. on the board in the Super Six and captured the WBA super middleweight title with a dominant 11 round technical decision over Denmark’s Kessler in their Group Stage 1 bout.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Ward defeats Kessler | journal = MyBoxingFans | date = 2009-11-29 | first = Edgar | last = Gonzalez| id = | url = http://www.myboxingfans.com/2009/11/ward-defeats-kessler/| accessdate = 2011-04-26}}</ref> The fight was stopped in round 11 due to cuts on Kessler's face caused by what was deemed unintentional headbutts by Ward. The fight went to the scorecards and Ward was far ahead by scores of 98–92, 98–92 and 97–93 at the time of the stoppage.

In January 2010 [[Jermain Taylor]] announced his exit from Showtime's Super Six World Boxing Classic tournament. [[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'']] Top 10 ranked [[super middleweight]] [[Allan Green]] was selected as his replacement and challenged Andre Ward on June 19.<ref>[http://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/article.aspx?subjectid=29&articleid=20100124_29_0_Egtyas348248&allcom=1 Tulsa's Allan Green] [[Tulsa World]] accessed February 17, 2010</ref> Ward, defending the WBA super middleweight title, outclassed an opponent who spent most of the fight with his back against the ropes. Ward defeated Green by unanimous decision on June 19, 2010.<ref name="record"/> Though the 30-year-old gamely fought on, the knockout he needed to win never appeared remotely likely and he looked a spent man by the end as he picked up the second loss of his 31-fight pro career.

Ward was exempt from the final preliminary fight in the Super Six because he had already secured a number one position in the elimination rounds and his designated opponent (Andre Dirrell) had dropped out of the tournament. Instead, Ward successfully defended his WBA super middleweight title, unanimously outpointing another Top 10 ranked super middleweight, [[Sakio Bika]], in front of a sparse crowd at Oracle Arena on Saturday night. Fighting in front of his hometown crowd as part of a dual-site co-main event, Ward didn't land many big shots but repeatedly hit Bika with a stinging left jab that the challenger was unable to counter. Ward won all 12 rounds on one judges scorecard and was ahead 118–110 on the other two.<ref>{{cite journal | title =Andre Ward defeats Sakio Bika| journal = ESPN | date = 2010-11-28 | first = Dan | last =Rafael| id = | url = http://www.myboxingfans.com/2009/11/ward-defeats-kessler/| accessdate = 2011-04-26}}</ref>

===== Ward vs. Abraham =====
{{Main|Andre Ward vs. Arthur Abraham}}
Ward's next title defense came against Top 10 ranked super middleweight [[Arthur Abraham]] on May 14, 2011 in [[Carson, California]]. Ward started out slow with Abraham, trying to find a way to penetrate his tight defense. After a competitive first few rounds, Ward seized control of the fight, using his ring savvy and instincts to control Abraham. Although Abraham was somewhat passive at times, he gave an earnest effort and frequently threw combinations that were mostly blocked by Ward. Abraham hurt Ward a couple of times in the final round, but it wasn't enough to finish Ward, who had dominated the fight and won a lopsided unanimous decision.

===== Ward vs. Froch =====
{{Main|Carl Froch vs. Andre Ward}}
Andre Ward won the [[Super Six World Boxing Classic]] tournament in a dramatic bout against [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] super middleweight champion Carl Froch. The vacant [[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'']] super middleweight title would be on the line in the fight, as well as Froch and Ward's super middleweight titles. In the first 7 rounds, Ward outboxed Froch, successfully using his jab to neutralize Froch and beating Froch to the punch from a distance and at close range. In the later rounds, Ward seemed to take his foot off the gas, leaving Froch to win a couple rounds near the end of the fight, though they were close and fairly competitive rounds. The judges scorecards were 115–113, 115–113 and 118–110, all in favor of Ward. Ward won the vacant [[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'']] super middleweight title.

The World Boxing Council Board of Governors voted to make Ward "Champion in Recess" due to a broken hand Ward had sustained during the Super Six tournament.<ref>http://www.boxingscene.com/dirrell-sjekloca-wbc-title-ward-champion-recess--52210</ref>

==== Ward vs. Dawson ====
Ward's next fight was set for September 8, 2012 against [[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'']] [[Light Heavyweight]] Champion [[Chad Dawson]]. The fight was at 168&nbsp;lbs for Ward's super middleweight titles. It ended in round 10 with a technical knockout victory for Ward when Dawson asked the referee for the fight to be ended with the words: "It's over. I'm finished. I'm done."

In the first two rounds, Ward and Dawson felt each other out, with neither fighter having much success, though Dawson was able to land a few counter right hooks as Ward lunged inside. In the third round, Ward dropped Dawson with a left hook and dominated the round. Again in the fourth round, Ward was able to drop Dawson, in another dominating round. From fifth round until the end of the fight, Ward was able to neutralize Dawson's jab and work rate, seemingly out boxing and frustrating Dawson throughout. Then, in the tenth round, Ward dropped Dawson to a knee after a solid combination, which prompted referee Steve Smoger to stop the fight after Dawson could not continue.


Ward was scheduled to defend his super middleweight titles against former [[Lineal championship|lineal]], WBC, and [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[middleweight]] champion [[Kelly Pavlik]] on January 26, 2013 at the [[Galen Center]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. However, an injury sustained by Ward originally postponed the bout for 4 more weeks and the fight was expected to take place on February 23, 2013.  The injury was more severe than originally thought and led to the cancellation of the fight as well as the subsequent retirement of Pavlik.<ref>http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/8783129/andre-ward-kelly-pavlik-fight-canceled-ward-shoulder-surgery</ref>

==== WBC title ====
On March 23rd 2013 the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] stripped Ward of the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[super middleweight|super-middleweight]] title belt for being inactive for a long period of time, and for failing to face a mandatory challenger. They granted him champion emeritus status. Ward claimed a shoulder injury that required surgery was the reason for his inactivity, but the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] claimed that Ward had not provided any medical evidence or even given them a rough availability date.<ref>{{cite news|last=.com|first=Fightingnews|title=WBC Statement on Andre Ward|url=http://www.fightnews.com/Boxing/wbc-statement-on-andre-ward-199960}}</ref>

On May 20th, Ward relinquished the champion emeritus title, stating that he did not believe the WBC had the right to strip him of the world title because he was willing and able to defend it within the period specified by the WBC's rules. Ward was praised for standing up to the WBC.<ref>{{Cite web  | last =Iole | first =Kevin | title =Andre Ward tells the WBC to get lost, and hopefully he is the first of many | url = http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/boxing/andre-ward-tells-wbc-lost-hopefully-first-many-182452657.html | publisher =Yahoo!  | date = 21 May, 2013  | accessdate = 22 May, 2013 }}</ref>
