==== Bantamweight Tournament ====
===== Mares vs. Darchinyan =====
Golden Boy Promotions announced that Mares would be taking part in Showtime's four-man single elimination bantamweight tournament, which would also include [[Vic Darchinyan]], [[Joseph Agbeko]] and [[Yonnhy Perez]].
In the first round of the tournament, Mares faced [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] [[Bantamweight]] Champion Vic Darchinyan and defeated him by a highly controversial 12 round split decision to claim the IBO Championship title and WBC Silver title.

===== Mares vs. Agbeko I =====
{{Main|Abner Mares vs. Joseph Agbeko}}
Mares was scheduled to face IBF Champion and No. 3 ranked Joseph Agbeko in the final round of the tournament on April 23, 2011. However, Agbeko pulled out of the fight just days prior citing an injury. The match was rescheduled for August 13, 2011. Mares fought Agbeko on August 13 on Showtime and won the title and the tournament by majority decision. However, the match was not without controversy, as Mares delivered numerous low blows during the match, with referee Russell Mora not penalizing him with point deductions for any of the blows throughout the match. The most infamous of these blows came during the 11th round of the fight, in which a low blow from Mares landed on Agbeko's cup, causing Agbeko to drop. While the low blow was clearly visible to everyone, referee Mora ruled it as a knockdown.

==== Mares vs. Agbeko II ====
On December 3, 2011, Mares and Agbeko fought a rematch due to their controversial first fight. While the second fight proved to be much less controversial, there were still several low blow warnings from the referee to Mares. Though Agbeko had moments in the fight where he out boxed Mares from the outside, Mares closed the distance and out worked Agbeko throughout the fight, and landed the more significant punches. Mares was awarded a unanimous decision win, by the scores of 118-110 from all three judges.

=== Super Bantamweight ===
==== Super Bantamweight title ====
In Mares' next fight, he moved up to the [[super bantamweight]] division, fighting former world champion [[Eric Morel]] for the vacant WBC Super Bantamweight title. The fight took place on April 21, 2012, at a catchweight of 120 lbs. Mares effectively out worked, landed more, and landed the harder punches throughout the fight, with Morel showing significant signs of his age. Mares won a unanimous decision by the scores of 120-107, 119-109, and 119-109 to claim his first Super Bantamweight title.

==== Mares vs. Moreno ====
Mares' next fight is to take place on November 10, 2012, against the world No. 1 ranked bantamweight and current No.10 pound-for-pound [[Anselmo Moreno]]. mares started the fight off fast, applying relentless pressure on Moreno, forcing Moreno to the ropes for the majority of the early rounds. Moreno still had his moments while the two were in the middle of the ring, landing clean shots, while Mares attempted to out work Moreno and attack his body while on the ropes. In the 5th round, Moreno was having success staying off the ropes when he could, and out boxing Mares in the center of the ring. Near the end of the round, Mares trapped Moreno on the ropes and landed a hard straight right hand, which ultimately sent Moreno to the canvas for the first time in his career. The following middle rounds of the fight, Mares seemed in control working the body and landing his hard overhand right, relentless pressuring Moreno for the majority of the rounds. In the 11th round, Moreno was deducted a point for pushing Mares' head down while Mares rushed him on the ropes. This was seen as very controversial, given that Mares and Moreno both had been warned several times throughout the fight and only Moreno was deducted a point. After the point deduction, Moreno effectively out pointed Mares in the middle of the ring during the final rounds and even successfully traded with Mares against the ropes, while Mares seemed to tire the final couple rounds.

Mares was awarded the Unanimous decision by the scores of 116-110, 116-110, and 120-106. The fight was generally seen as much closer than the scorecards would indicate, but Mares was the clear winner of the fight in most eyes.

===Featherweight===
====Mares vs. De Leon====
Mares moved up to 126 lbs to fight WBC Featherweight champion and ''Ring'' No. 2 ranked Featherweight, [[Daniel Ponce de León]] in the [[Floyd Mayweather vs. Robert Guerrero|Mayweather-Guerrero]] undercard on May 4, 2013 and knocked down de León in the second and ninth rounds en route to handing him a TKO loss at 2:20 of the ninth round, winning the WBC featherweight title in the process.

====Mares vs. Gonzalez====
Mares will defend his WBC Featherweight title against [[Jhonny Gonzalez]] on August 24th 2013 at the [[StubHub Center]] in [[Carson]], [[California]].
