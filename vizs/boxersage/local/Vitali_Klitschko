'''Vitali Volodymyrovych Klitschko''' ({{IPAc-en|v|ɨ|ˈ|t|æ|l|i|_|ˈ|k|l|ɪ|tʃ|k|oʊ}}; {{lang-uk|Віта́лій Володи́мирович Кличко́}}, {{IPA-uk|ʋiˈtɑʎiɪ̯ klɪtʃˈkɔ|}}; born 19 July 1971) is a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] professional [[Boxing|boxer]] and the reigning [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[heavyweight]] champion. He is leader of the political party [[Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform]] and since 15 December 2012, a member of the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]].<ref name=VR7starts151212UW>[http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/60928 You Scratch My Back, and I’ll Scratch Yours], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (26 September 2012)</ref><ref name=BBCCAMP>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20031821 Q&A:Ukrainian parliamentary election], [[BBC News]] (23 October 2012)</ref><ref name=SvobBBC>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20113616 Ukraine election:President Yanukovych party claims win], [[BBC News]] (29 October 2012)</ref><ref name=UkrelecmoneyKP161112>[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/politics/parties-spend-over-hr-600-million-on-elections-according-to-report-316205.html Parties spend over Hr 600 million on elections, according to report], [[Kyiv Post]] (16 November 2012)</ref> He previously held the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] and [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] titles. Klitschko is the first professional boxing world champion to hold a PhD degree.

Klitschko is known for his powerful punches and durable chin. With a 87.23% knockout percentage rate, he holds the second best knockout-to-fight ratio of any champion in heavyweight boxing history, after [[Rocky Marciano]]'s 87.76% and currently the [[Longest reigning heavyweight champions|9th longest reigning Heavyweight Champion of all time]]. He has never been knocked down in any professional boxing bout and has also never lost a decision. His two losses have come via a shoulder injury during a fight and a deep cut above his eye, which were recorded as TKO losses. In both fights, however, he was leading on the scorecards. His power and his possession of a PhD have led to his nickname, Dr. Ironfist.

He was awarded Germany's highest civilian award, the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Federal Cross of Merit]], for his varied accomplishments.<ref>[http://bsanna-news.ukrinform.ua/newsitem.php?id=13264&lang=en Bsanna News – Bsanna News]. Bsanna-news.ukrinform.ua (4 June 2010). Retrieved on 2011-04-19.</ref> On 27 February 2012, ''[[Ring Magazine]]'' rated Vitali as the number nine [[Ring Magazine pound for pound|pound-for-pound]] boxer in the world.

Klitschko's younger brother, [[Wladimir Klitschko]], is the [[World Boxing Association|WBA (Super)]], [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]], [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]], [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] and ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' World Heavyweight Champion.

== Kickboxing ==
Originally Klitschko was an amateur [[kickboxing|kickboxer]]. In 1992 he was knocked out by a spin kick to the jaw<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=9n7zExsuCRU</ref> in the final of the European Kickboxing Championships +89&nbsp;kg light contact division by Englishman [[Pelé Reid]]. {{Dubious|kickboxing|date=August 2011}} In 1993 he defeated [[Ryushi Yanagisawa]] in the Japanese [[mixed martial arts]] promotion [[Pancrase]] under [[World Kickboxing Association|WKA]] Special Rules (no low kicks) via R5 decision. In 1994 he defeated Richard Vince  by second round KO to retain his [[International Sport Karate Association|ISKA]] World [[Super Heavyweight]] title.Vince was out for at least 3 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|author=TheRealVinnySharp |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTYjTvwOC6M |title=Vitali Klitschko vs Ryushi Yanagisawa |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2011-11-27}}</ref> In 1996 he turned professional and compiled a record of 34–1 with 22 knockouts. He was a world champion six times (professional and amateur).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/boxing-news/Vitali-Klitschko-Interview.php |title=Interview: Head 2 Head with Vitali Klitschko |publisher=Eastsideboxing.com |accessdate=2011-11-27}}</ref>

== Boxing career ==
Klitschko won the Super Heavyweight Championship at the first [[World Military Games]] in Italy in 1995. Vitali won the silver medal at the [[1995 World Amateur Boxing Championships]] in Berlin, Germany, where he was defeated by Russia's [[Alexei Lezin]] in the final. In his autobiography, published in Germany in 2004, the boxer revealed that he tested positive for a banned [[Anabolic steroid|steroid]] in 1996. He attributed the presence of the drug to treatment of a leg injury but was dismissed from the Ukrainian boxing team and missed the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta Olympics]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxingandmma/2389404/Boxing-Klitschko-admits-steroid-abuse.html|title=Klitschko admits steroid abuse|date=2 November 2004|work=Telegraph Sport|accessdate=2010-04-08|location=London|first=Bob|last=Mee}}</ref> His brother Wladimir moved up from [[heavyweight]] to super heavyweight to take his place in the squad and won the Olympic gold medal. His amateur record was 195–15 with 80 knockouts.

=== Klitschko vs. Hide: First Heavyweight title ===
Klitschko began his professional boxing career in 1996, winning his first twenty-four fights by either early [[knockout]] or technical knockout (TKO). He and Wladimir signed with the German athlete-promotion company [[Universum]]. With both brothers holding PhDs and being multilingual, their refined and articulate personalities made for mainstream marketability when they moved to Germany and Universum. In time, they became national celebrities in their adopted home country. In his 25th pro fight, on 26 June 1999, Klitschko won the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[Heavyweight]] title from [[Herbie Hide]] of the United Kingdom by a second round knockout.

He successfully defended the title twice. He defeated Ed Mahone by knockout in the third round and beat [[Obed Sullivan]], who retired after the ninth round.

=== Klitschko vs. Byrd ===
By April 2000 Vitali Klitschko was unbeaten and one of the top stars in the heavyweight division and a prime candidate to be the next [[Undisputed Champion]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} He had won all 27 of his contests by knockout. On 1 April, Klitschko had a third title defense against the American [[Chris Byrd]], who was a late replacement. Byrd made himself a difficult target and tried to thwart Klitschko's offense by being elusive. Klitschko won most of the rounds and was heading towards a comprehensive points victory when he suffered a serious shoulder injury. After the ninth round, Klitschko notified his corner that he had a shoulder pain and [[submission (combat sport)|threw in the towel]], thus handing Klitschko his first defeat and awarding Byrd the win by technical knockout. At the time of the stoppage, Klitschko had a lead on all three judges' scorecards (89–82, and 88–83 twice). Klitschko, who was later diagnosed with a torn [[rotator cuff]], received much criticism for quitting the fight.

Klitschko rebounded from his loss to Byrd by reeling off five victories in a row, earning himself a shot at [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Heavyweight Champion [[Lennox Lewis]] on 21 June 2003 in Los Angeles.

=== Klitschko vs. Lennox Lewis ===
{{Main|Lennox Lewis vs. Vitali Klitschko}}
Klitschko, a 4–1 underdog, dominated the early going with many harder punches. He stunned Lewis in the second round with two hard rights, leaving a cut under on Lennox's left eye.<ref name="lewis">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/22/sports/boxing-lewis-cuts-the-deepest-and-retains-his-title.html?scp=10&sq=klitschko%20lewis&st=cse|title=Lewis Cuts the Deepest and Retains His Title|last=Freeman|first=Mike|date=22 June 2003|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-06-22}}</ref> In the third, Lewis landed a big right hand that opened a deep cut above Klitschko's left eye.<ref name="lewis"/> Lewis began to specifically target Vitali's cut. In the fourth round at 1:23, Lennox threw some body shots in a clinch. The referee told them to separate several times before actually separating them himself. This happened again at :33, with [[Jim Lampley]] saying, "Lewis taking advantage of the clinch to pound Vitali Klitschko to the belly." After the fourth round, [[Emanuel Steward]], Lewis' trainer, could be heard telling Lewis, "One thing, you're pushing him all the time now. Keep pushing your weight on him, all while you're inside clinching." Klitschko was able to rally and Lewis, who had weighed in at his career heaviest for the fight, was breathing heavily after a few rounds. Perhaps the most controversial part came in round 5 at 2:12. Lampley commented throughout, "And good professional work by Lewis against the ribcage. As Vitali takes it, takes it, takes it, takes it! And referee Lou Moret just looks on!" [[George Foreman]] replied, "I don't know how the referee can let that holding and hitting go on." [[Larry Merchant]] told Foreman, "One punch, one hand is open. And you're allowed to do that, George-" "You can not hold and hit! If one guy's holding you, you have to break it!" Foreman told Merchant. Both men traded big shots, and in the sixth Lewis got through with a hard uppercut. As the sixth round was ending, Lewis punched Klitschko's injured eye twice in another clinch. Before the seventh round, the ringside doctor inspected the wound and deemed it severe enough to threaten eye damage if struck again, stopping the fight despite Klitschko's pleas to continue. Klitschko was ahead on all three judges' scorecards 58–56 (4 rounds to 2) at the time of the stoppage, but because the wound was a result of punches from Lewis, Lewis won by [[technical knockout]].<ref name="lewis"/>

Lampley referred to the crowd's reaction, "You heard the response to the stoppage: Almost universal booing in the house." Klitschko, despite the loss, gained international respect for fighting so well against the Heavyweight Champion for 6 rounds. Negotiations for a 6 December rematch began.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/boxing-lewis-set-to-retire-after-rematch-with-klitschko-588533.html|title=Boxing: Lewis set to retire after re-match with Klitschko|date=31 July 2003|work=The Independent | location=London | first=Kieran | last=Daley | accessdate=27 May 2010}}</ref> After negotiations collapsed, Vitali defeated Kirk Johnson in a WBC Eliminator bout on 6 December date,<ref>[http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Vitali_Klitschko_vs._Kirk_Johnson Vitali Klitschko vs. Kirk Johnson – Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia]. Boxrec.com. Retrieved on 2011-04-19.</ref> setting up a mandatory rematch with Lewis. In January 2004, the WBC announced that it would strip Lewis of the belt if he let pass a 15 March deadline to sign for a rematch with Vitali.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/2004-01-25-lewis-wbc_x.htm |title=WBC to Lewis: Fight or else | work=USA Today | first1=Dan |last1=Rafael |date=27 January 2004}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, Lewis announced his retirement and vacated the title. For years after this fight, Klitschko would still occasionally call out Lewis, despite the fact that Lewis has been retired since early 2004, for a rematch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&id=16423.html |title=Vitali Klitschko Only Interested in Lennox Lewis, Valuev – Boxing News |publisher=Boxingscene.com |accessdate=2009-11-01}}</ref>

Around this time, the Klitschko brothers moved from [[Hamburg]], Germany to Los Angeles.

In January 2004, they notified Universum that they would not re-sign when their contracts expired in April. Universum sued the brothers, arguing that their recent injuries had triggered a clause binding them beyond April. The suit was ultimately resolved in favor of the Klitschkos in November 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=21793&more=1 |title=Klitschko Bros KO Universum |publisher=Eastsideboxing.com |accessdate=2009-11-11}}</ref>

=== Klitschko vs. Sanders: Second Heavyweight Title ===
Klitschko faced South African [[Corrie Sanders]] on 24 April 2004, for the [[World Boxing Council]] heavyweight championship and the ''[[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'']]'' belts that had been vacated by Lewis. Sanders had stopped younger brother Wladimir in the second round (TKO) on 8 March 2003. Klitschko was rocked in round one by Sanders, but by using upper-body movement and accurate punching he broke down Sanders, forcing referee Jon Schorle to stop the bout. Vitali landed 60% of his power punches.

=== Klitschko vs. Williams ===
Vitali Klitschko's first WBC title defense was against British boxer [[Danny Williams (boxer)|Danny Williams]]. Williams had become suddenly marketable from a KO over [[Mike Tyson]] in round 4. Klitschko scored a technical knockout against Williams in 8 rounds on 11 December 2004, while wearing an orange cloth to show support for the Ukrainian presidential opposition movement. Klitschko knocked Williams down in the 1st, 3rd, 7th, and 8th rounds before the fight was stopped. Immediately afterward, Klitschko dedicated his victory to democracy in his native Ukraine and also to the Ukrainian presidential candidate [[Viktor Yushchenko]], whom he supported in the 26 December 2004, [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|election revote]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E3DF1F31F931A25751C1A9629C8B63&fta=y |title=Klitschko Remains a Champion In a Dominating Show of Force |work=New York Times |date=12 December 2004 |accessdate=2009-11-01}}</ref>

=== Original retirement ===
On 9 November 2005, Vitali Klitschko announced his retirement from professional boxing and vacated his title. He had been training to fight Hasim Rahman, but unfortunately, just 9 days before the fight, he had entangled his leg with his sparring partner, causing them to fall heavily. He snapped his [[anterior cruciate ligament]], a very serious injury, which would take up to a year to heal, with surgery, and possibly would be career ending. To avoid keeping the title out of use, he retired. The WBC was grateful for his consideration. On other occasions he cited regrets about his suddenly mounting injuries, a desire to leave the sport while still on top and political aspirations in his home country of Ukraine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2220413 |title=Rahman: If not Vitali, bring on Wlad |publisher=ESPN |date=10 November 2005 |accessdate=2009-11-01}}</ref> Following his retirement, the WBC conferred "champion emeritus" status on Klitschko, and assured him he would become the mandatory challenger if and when he decided to return.<ref>{{cite news|last=Davies |first=Gareth A |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxingandmma/3184341/David-Haye-confident-he-can-take-down-both-Klitschko-brothers.html |title=David Haye confident he can take down both Klitschko brothers |work=The Daily Telegraph  |date=12 October 2008 |accessdate=2009-11-01|location=London}}</ref>

He announced his comeback in the 24 January 2007 edition of the German newspaper ''[[Bild-Zeitung]]'', and requested that he be allowed to fight again.

=== Klitschko vs. Peter: Third Heavyweight Title ===
On 3 August 2008, the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] awarded Klitschko a chance to regain his WBC Heavyweight title. After Vitali's retirement, his younger brother had established dominance in the division, winning two of the four world titles available. The reigning WBC Champion was [[Samuel Peter]] (who had lost a decision to Wladimir in a thrilling fight in 2005). At the time there was interest in a potential Peter vs Wladimir unification match. Instead Vitali took advantage of his champion emeritus status and secured a title challenge against Peter. The fight was arranged on 11 October 2008 at [[O2 World (Berlin)|O2 World, Berlin]]. It would be one of the most anticipated heavyweight fights in the past few years. Both men had a rightful claim to being the champion and the stakes for the future of the heavyweight division were high. Despite some questioning Vitali's decision to return after four years, he managed to regain his title in dominating fashion. Klitschko had Peter intimidated from the first round and stunned him with accurate hard punches. Klitschko kept the hard punching Nigerian off with an effective left jab and took control in the center of the ring. Over eight rounds Klitschko completely dismantled and outfought the younger champion. After the eighth round, Peter slumped on his stool, shook his head and asked that the bout be stopped. With the Samuel Peter victory, Klitschko technically became one of the few men to ever hold a version of the World Heavyweight Championship three times – WBO (1999–2000), WBC (2004–2005) WBC (2008 – present), albeit the WBO belt was not considered a major belt when Vitali won it, and has almost always been in all weight classes contested by men not considered the best in their respective divisions, thus making any claim to Vitali being a 'three time champion' contentious.

=== Klitschko vs. Gomez, Arreola & Johnson ===
On 21 March 2009, Klitschko defeated [[Juan Carlos Gomez]] by TKO in the ninth round. Gomez tried to use his movement to thwart Vitali but seemed unable to cope with the power and physical strength of his opponent. As the rounds progressed, Klitschko began imposing himself on Gomez more and more. Gomez soon became wary of Klitschko's power and also began to tire physically. By the sixth round Vitali was in total control. The end came when the referee stopped the fight in the ninth round as Gomez appeared unable to withstand any more hits.

On 26 September, Klitschko earned a one-sided TKO victory over [[Chris Arreola]] at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California when Arreola's trainer, Henry Ramirez, asked the referee to stop the fight.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/boxing/8274233.stm|title=Dominant Klitschko beats Arreola |date=27 September 2009|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-09-28}}</ref> Arreola was considered at the time one of the division's hardest punchers; however, Klitschko kept Arreola at bay with his left jab and hit him almost at will with his right. Arreola had been influenced by Samuel Peter's defeat to Klitschko in 2008, in which Peter had tried to box from the outside. He therefore employed a game-plan which involved applying constant pressure to Vitali in order to force him into a high tempo fight. Despite his best efforts, the bout became one sided very quickly. Klitschko consistently proved himself faster, sharper and much fitter than Arreola.

On 12 December Vitali defeated [[Kevin Johnson (boxer)|Kevin Johnson]] by unanimous decision, winning almost every round. Johnson, a skillful fighter, tried to negate Klitschko's strength with angles and head movement, though he proved hard to hit he failed to launch any sustained attack of his own. After the Johnson bout, Klitschko's camp began negotiations for a potential fight with former WBA Champion [[Nikolai Valuev]], but the match failed to materialize due to economic disagreements.<ref>{{cite web

=== Klitschko vs. Sosnowski, Briggs & Solis ===
[[File:Klitschko vs Sosnowski.JPG|thumb|Klitschko vs Sosnowski, 29 May 2010]]
On 29 May 2010 Vitali Klitschko defeated [[Poles|Polish]] heavyweight contender [[Albert Sosnowski]] by KO at 2:30 in round 10 of 12.Sosnowski was knocked down by a right hand in the 10th round, prompting referee Jay Nady to immediately wave off the fight. The fight took place at [[Veltins Arena]], [[Gelsenkirchen]], [[Nordrhein-Westfalen]], Germany.
Vitali Klitschko weighed in at 112&nbsp;kg (247&nbsp;lbs), while Sosnowski weighed in at 110&nbsp;kg (242.5&nbsp;lbs).
This voluntary defence was Vitali's 4th defence of the WBC Heavyweight title. Sosnowski was the #11 ranked heavyweight according to the WBC prior to this bout.

On 17 August 2010, it was announced that Klitschko would defend his WBC title against [[Shannon Briggs]] on 16 October of that year. Klitschko completely dismantled his challenger with superior hand speed. Briggs struggled to land any meaningful punches, as Klitschko won every round decisively. After a few rounds, Briggs was receiving a vicious and sustained beating which caused him serious facial injuries. Considering the beating he was receiving, there was some suggestion that the referee should have stopped the bout during the last few rounds. Klitschko had retained his belt with official scores of 120–107, 120–105, and 120–107.<ref>{{cite web |last =Sukachev |first =Alexey |title =Vitali Klitschko Gives Briggs a Brutal Beating in Hamburg |publisher =BoxingScene.com |date =16 October 2010 |url =http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&id=31898 |accessdate =5 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title =Vitali Klitschko Keeps His Title |work=The New York Times |date =17 October 2010 |url =http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/sports/17sportsbriefs-Wbc.html?_r=1&ref=vitaliklitschko |accessdate =8 January 2011}}</ref> During the post-fight interview, the American boxer said: “I’ve fought George Foreman, I’ve fought Lennox Lewis, and Vitali’s the best.” While Klitschko did not knock down Briggs, the latter collapsed after the fight and was hospitalized with facial fractures and a torn biceps.

Klitschko's next fight was against mandatory challenger [[Odlanier Solis]].

The fight lasted less than one whole round, as a right hand to Solis's temple wobbled Solis, who then twisted his knee. Klitschko won by KO.<ref>[http://www.klitschko.com/eng/Home.html Home – Klitschko.com – English]. Klitschko.com.

[[File:Adamek and Klitschko.jpg|thumb|Klitschko and Adamek, during signing for the fight in 2011]]

=== Klitschko vs. Adamek, Chisora & Charr ===
{{Main|Vitali Klitschko vs. Tomasz Adamek}}
Now aged 40, Klitschko retained his WBC heavyweight title against [[Tomasz Adamek]] on 10 September 2011 in Poland, winning by TKO in the 10th round. The referee stopped the bout after Adamek received punishing blows and was ruled out, as he was no longer able to defend himself.

After turning 41 on 19 July 2012, Vitali became one of the oldest Heavyweight Champions in history. Despite having a four-year hiatus from the sport, Vitali has proven to be a remarkably effective and dominant Heavyweight Champion once again. Alongside his brother Wladimir, he also fights on for their shared ambition of holding all four Heavyweight Championship belts together, an ambition that was realised on 2 July 2011 when brother Wladimir defeated [[David Haye]] to win the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Heavyweight Championship. In January 2012, he was awarded WBC Fighter of the Year for 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/sports/20120118/170829386.html|title=Klitschko Named WBC Fighter of 2011|date=18 January 2012|publisher=RIA Novosti|accessdate=18 February 2012}}</ref> Klitschko was in negotiations for a possible bout with former WBA Heavyweight title holder [[David Haye]] on 3 March 2012.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/15927657.stm |work=BBC News | title=Haye confirms Kiltschko fight talks | date=28 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/boxing/3968197/David-Haye-could-fight-Vitali-Klitschko-in-March.html | location=London | work=The Sun | first=Pat | last=Sheehan|title=David Haye could fight Vitali Klitschko in March}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxing/8924501/David-Haye-has-a-deal-on-the-table-to-go-ahead-and-fight-WBC-world-heavyweight-champion-Vitali-Klitschko-next-year.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Gareth A | last=Davies | title=David Haye has a deal on the table to go ahead and fight WBC world heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko next year | date=30 November 2011}}</ref>

Vitali won the majority of the rounds boxing a disciplined fight with changing angles and superior footwork. Chisora, constantly coming forward delivering punishing body shots, failed to wear down the older man. The scores were: 118–110, 118–110, 119–111.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The next day, Vitali visited a hospital to check his shoulder, claiming he injured it in the fight. A doctor confirmed a ligament tear was suffered in Vitali's left shoulder. Klitschko said he "suddenly lost strength in the left hand" and was forced to only use his right. The injury was believed to have happened in the second or third round. Klitschko's trainer, Fritz Zdunek, believes this is the same kind of injury Vitali suffered in his fight with Byrd.<ref>[http://www.boxingscene.com/vitali-gets-medical-check-left-shoulder-injury-confirmed--49758 Vitali Gets Medical Check, Left Shoulder Injury Confirmed – Boxing News].

At the post fight press conference a brawl ensued between David Haye and Dereck Chisora. After the altercation Dereck Chisora challenged David Haye to a fight in the ring and said, "I am going to shoot David Haye." Dereck Chisora was later arrested at a German airport along with his coach, Don Charles. His comments and actions were later condemned by Frank Warren, his promoter, and Wladimir Klitschko.

== Controversy ==
Vitali Klitschko has admitted in his autobiography to having used steroids earlier in his career. He revealed using steroids after aggravating a leg injury that he had previously sustained during a kick-boxing bout.<ref name=positive>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxing/2389404/Boxing-Klitschko-admits-steroid-abuse.html|title=Boxing: Klitschko admits steroid abuse|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2 November 2004}}</ref>

While Vitali was still fighting as an amateur for the Ukrainian boxing team in 1996, he tested positive for a banned substance and was immediately thrown off the team. At the time, he was training for the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Atlanta Olympics]]. Since then, Vitali has tested clean for Steroids during his entire professional career.<ref name=positive/>

== Personal life ==
[[File:Klitschko's back in the days.jpg|thumb|[[Klitschko brothers]] with their parents.]]
His father, Vladimir Rodionovich Klitschko (1947–2011), was a [[Soviet Air Force]] [[major general]] and a [[military attaché]] of the Soviet Union in the [[East Germany]]. He was also one of the commanders in charge of cleaning up the effects of the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster]] in 1986 and was afterward diagnosed with cancer.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} His mother is Nadezhda Ulyanovna.<ref>[http://kp.ua/daily/130711/290155/ У братьев Кличко умер отец]. Komsomolskaya Pravda (in Russian) 13 July 2011</ref>

Klitschko is married to Natalia Egorova, a former athlete and model. They met in Kiev and got married on 26 April 1996. He has three children, Yegor-Daniel, Elizabeth-Victoria and Max (named after the former World Heavyweight Champion [[Max Schmeling]]).<ref>[http://sport.segodnya.ua/boxing/818925.html Кличко улетел от жены, как 14 лет назад]. Segondnya (in Russian). 26 April 2010</ref><ref>[http://men.org.ua/rus/?action=celeb&cid=65 Виталий Кличко]. men.org.ua</ref>

In 1996, he graduated from the Pereyaslav-Khmelnytsky Pedagogical Institute (Ukraine) and was accepted into the postgraduate study program at the [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv]]. On 29 February 2000, he presented his doctoral thesis on "talent and sponsorship in sports"<ref>[http://cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/fw32002.htm CyberBoxingZone News, 29-02-2000 "Calling Dr. Klitschko"]. Retrieved 7 November 2008.</ref> at the "Kyiv University of Physical Science and Sports" and his PhD in Sports Science was conferred.

Both Vitali and his brother are avid chess players. Vitali is a friend of former world chess champion [[Vladimir Kramnik]] and the two have played, with Kramnik always winning. Vitali has commented that "chess is similar to boxing. You need to develop a strategy, and you need to think two or three steps ahead about what your opponent is doing. You have to be smart. But what's the difference between chess and boxing? In chess, nobody is an expert, but everybody plays. In boxing everybody is an expert, but nobody fights."<ref>{{cite web|author=HBO |url=http://www.hbo.com/boxing/fighters/klitschko_vitali/bio.html |title=Boxing: Fighters: Bio: VITALI KLITSCHKO |publisher=HBO |date=27 September 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-01}}</ref>

Vitali and his brother also have been involved in charitable activities dedicated to support the needs of schools, churches and children. In 2002, the Klitschko brothers announced that they had agreed to work for [[UNESCO]].
