==Professional boxing==
After an amateur career that took him to the Athens Olympics, where he won a silver medal, Golovkin turned pro in Germany and won his first 19 fights, 16 by knockout.

===1st Middleweight Major Title===
On August 14, 2010, he won the vacant [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Interim Middleweight Title, defeating [[Milton Nunez (boxer)|Milton Nunez]] by 1st-round KO in [[Panama City]], Panama. He was later then promoted to the status of WBA Regular Champion after the current champion at the time [[Felix Sturm]] was promoted to Super Champion by the WBA. In December 2010, he made his first successful WBA title defence by defeating [[Colombia|Colombia's]] [[Nilson Julio Tapia]] via KO in the 3rd round. Golovkin then defended his belt against former IBF Light Middleweight champion [[Kassim Ouma]], defeating him in the 10th round by TKO.

===Signing with K2 and training with Abel Sanchez===
[[File:Gennady Golovkin vs. Gabriel Rosado.jpg|thumb|Distant view of Golovkin fighting against Gabriel Rosado at Madison Square Garden in January 2013.]]
Golovkin was determined to become a worldwide name, dreaming of following in the Klitschko brothers’ footsteps by fighting in [[Madison Square Garden]] and [[Staples Center]]. He signed with K2 and went into training in Big Bear, Calif., with Abel Sanchez, the veteran trainer behind Terrible Terry Norris and many other top talents. Sanchez was stunned by Golovkin’s talent, and impressed by his attitude from their first meeting. He’s trying to add Mexican-style aggression to Golovkin’s Soviet-style amateur discipline, hopefully producing a fearsome hybrid champion. “I have a chalkboard in the gym, and I wrote Ali’s name, Floyd Mayweather’s name and his name,” Sanchez said. “I told him, `You could be right there.’ He was all sheepish, but once I felt his hands, and I saw how smart he was in the ring and how he caught on... sheesh. He’s going to be the most-avoided fighter in boxing, or he’s going to get the chance he deserves.” <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/aug/31/golovkin-heads-to-us-with-middleweight-title-hopes/ |title=Golovkin heads to US with middleweight title hopes - The Washington Times |publisher=Greg Beacham |date= |accessdate=2013-01-16}}</ref>

===Dual Champion and Defending the Belts===
In December 2011, Golovkin fought against 2-time title challenger [[Lajuan Simon]] for the vacant [[International Boxing Organisation|IBO]] [[Middleweight]] Title. Simon had never been stopped before and Golovkin floored him with a left hook in the first round which he was unable to get up from, winning his 2nd World Title in the process. Golovkin successfully defended his WBA title for the 4th time and IBO title for the 1st when he took on and defeated [[Japan|Japan's]] Makoto Fuchigami, earning a TKO victory in the 3rd round. Both of these fights were broadcast on [[BoxNation]], exposing Golovkin to English viewers who were impressed with his performances.

===HBO Debut and Fighting in America===
Golovkin put on an impressive performance in his American debut on HBO by battering [[Grzegorz Proksa]] until a stoppage was called in the fifth round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/8330303/gennady-golovkin-stops-grzegorz-proksa-impressive-us-debut |title= Gennady Golovkin wins fight - ESPN Boxing |publisher=Associated Press |date= |accessdate=2013-01-16}}</ref> In October when WBA Super Middleweight Champion [[Daniel Geale]] signed to fight [[Anthony Mundine]] in a rematch, the WBA stripped Geale of the title and named Golovkin the sole WBA champion at middleweight.<ref>[http://www.eastsideboxing.com/2012/gennady-golovkin-named-sole-wba-middleweight-champion/ Gennady Golovkin named “sole WBA middleweight champion”], East Side Boxing, 1 November 2012</ref> Golovkin then followed up his Proksa win with a TKO victory over [[Gabriel Rosado]] on the HBO Salido-Garcia card in the co-main event. The fight was halted when Rosado’s corner threw in the towel to save Rosado, who was bleeding badly from his left eye and nose.<ref>[http://www.boxingnews24.com/2013/01/golovkin-stops-rosado-in-7th-in-blood-bath/ Golovkin stops Rosado in 7th in blood bath], Boxing News 24, 19 January 2013</ref> On 30 March, 2013 Golovkin knocked out [[Nobuhiro Ishida]] in the third round with a vicious overhand right.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/boxing/post/_/id/2121/golovkin-stays-busy-but-ready-for-true-test|title=Golovkin stays busy but ready for true test|author=Brian Campbell|date=March 30, 2013|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=March 31, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&opt=printable&id=63890|title=Golovkin Stops Ishida Easy: Rodriguez and Grachev Win|author=Alexey Sukachev|date=March 30, 2013|publisher=BoxingScene.com|accessdate=March 31, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/blog/178041|title=Golovkin stops Ishida in third round with single shot|date=March 30, 2013|publisher=''The Ring''|accessdate=March 31, 2013}}</ref><ref group="Video">{{Cite video|date=June 17, 2013|title=Gennady Golovkin Highlights (HBO Boxing) |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_NLVvQgcA0|medium=[[YouTube]] video: Fights against Grzegorz Proksa, Gabriel Rosado and Nobuhiro Ishida|publisher=[[HBO|HBO Sports]]|accessdate=June 28, 2013}}</ref> Golovkin won by body shot KO in round three against [[Matthew Macklin]] to retain his [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] and [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Middleweight titles on June 30, 2013.
