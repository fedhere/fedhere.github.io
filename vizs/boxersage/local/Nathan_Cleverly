'''Nathan Cleverly''' (born 17 February 1987) is a Welsh [[professional boxer]] and current [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[light heavyweight]] [[List of light heavyweight boxing champions|world champion]]. He is also the former [[European Boxing Union|European]], British and Commonwealth [[light heavyweight]] champion.<ref name="record 1">[http://www.boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=324239&cat=boxer Boxrec | Nathan Cleverly professional record]</ref><ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/7662521.stm|title=Cleverly wins Commonwealth crown|work=BBC Sport |date=10 October 2008}}</ref> He graduated with a BSc in Mathematics from [[Cardiff University]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south+east+wales-10636320 |work=BBC News  | title=Boxing champ Nathan Cleverly swaps gloves for gown | date=14 July 2010}}</ref>

==Professional career==
Cleverly made his professional debut in July 2005 with a four round victory over [[Journeyman (boxing)|journeyman Ernie Smith]] at the [[Meadowbank Stadium|Meadowbank]] Sports Center in [[Edinburgh]] and within a year had compiled a winning ledger of 6–0.  His first fight of substance however was in October 2006 when he met Liverpool's [[Tony Quigley]] at the [[MEN Arena]] in Manchester.  The fight which was on the undercard to the match up between [[Joe Calzaghe]] and [[Sakio Bika]] ended in a 5th round stoppage for Cleverly and handed Quigley his first pro defeat.

The next big test for the young prospect took place at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]] just over a year later in September 2007 when Cleverly met tough Ugandan Joey Vegas.  Cleverly at that time boasted a record of 10–0 and Vegas 10–1.  The fight ended with a gruelling points win over 8 rounds for the Welshman in what was his toughest fight to date.  Speaking about the result to the BBC and referring to the sparring he received in the [[Enzo Calzaghe]] gym, Cleverly said ''"I'm still young and won't be hitting my peak for about eight years, but think how good the wars I'm having in the gym now are doing me for the future&nbsp;... I want to keep on progressing, to go for the British title, then maybe a world crown in a couple of years."''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/boxing/7078017.stm|title=I'm on Calzaghe trail – Cleverly|work=BBC Sport |date=4 November 2007|last=Davies|first=Sean}}</ref>

Cleverly had made a point of fighting on the undercards of his stablemate [[Joe Calzaghe]] with the Vegas fight being one of the prelims to Calzaghe's World title unification fight against [[Mikkel Kessler]].  The next stop however was the real Vegas, Las Vegas to support Calzaghe's attempt to win ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]''{{'}}s Light heavyweight belt against American fighter [[Bernard Hopkins]].  Cleverly, fighting outside the UK for the first time as a pro also faced American opposition and beat Antonio Baker over 8 rounds.<ref name="record 1"/><ref>[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sports/grassroots/rhymney-valley-sport/2008/04/24/boxing-a-winner-like-joe-91466-20808812/ Wales Online | A winner like Joe]</ref>

In September 2008, the young boxer chose to leave Enzo Calzaghe's [[Newbridge boxing club]] where he had trained throughout his career and begin training at his father's gym in South Wales.  Speaking about his decision to leave the gym Cleverly said  ''"I have been trained by Enzo Calzaghe for six years since my youth days so leaving him has been one of the hardest decision I've ever had to make&nbsp;... Enzo is largely responsible for where I am in my career and I cannot thank him enough for what he has done for me."''  Cleverly had been concerned following the legal wranglings between promoter [[Frank Warren (promoter)|Frank Warren]] and his former stablemate [[Joe Calzaghe]] and added ''"I cannot take any chances with my career&nbsp;... I take boxing very seriously and want to be world champion. Hopefully Frank can sort that out for me."''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/7598818.stm|title=Cleverly leaves Calzaghe stable|work=BBC Sport |date=5 September 2008}}</ref>

===Commonwealth champion===

In October 2008, Cleverly landed a shot at the vacant Commonwealth light heavyweight title topping the bill for the first time in his career at the [[Everton Park, Liverpool|Everton Park]] Sports Centre in [[Liverpool]].  His opponent was the experienced former British champion [[Tony Oakey]] who he beat on points over 12 rounds.  Speaking after picking up his first belt Cleverly said ''"What a memorable night for me, winning a title is something I have dreamed of since I was a kid&nbsp;... I have worked hard for this but this is just the start for me – I want to rule the world."''<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/>  

Cleverly defended his title just two months later in December against Kenyan Douglas Otieno.  The African fighter, who came into the contest with a record of 18–1, was no match for the [[Welshman]] and was stopped in the 4th round.<ref>BBC Sport | Cleverly shines in first defence</ref>  In February 2009 he defended for the second time against another [[Kenyan]], Samson Onyang winning via knockout in the 1st round.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/7879424.stm|title=Double-quick victory for Cleverly|work=BBC Sport |date=13 February 2009}}</ref> On 22 May 2009 he scored a second round stoppage over Billy Boyle for his third defence of the title.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/8027479.stm|title=Easy title defence for Cleverly|work=BBC Sport |date=22 May 2009}}</ref>

===British champion===
The victory over Boyle set Cleverly up for a shot at the vacant British title on 18 July 2009 against English champion [[Danny McIntosh]].  Fighting at the [[York Hall]] Cleverly knocked McIntosh down on four occasions before the referee stepped in to stop the fight in the 7th round ensuring that Cleverly could add the [[Lonsdale Belt]] to his Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/8157691.stm|title=Cleverly stops McIntosh for title|work=BBC Sport |date=18 July 2009}}</ref>  Following the victory Cleverly laid claim to being the best light heavyweight in Britain, despite the fact that fellow Brit [[Clinton Woods]] was soon to be travelling to Florida in a challenge for the vacant IBF World title against [[Tavoris Cloud]].  Cleverly saying that whenever the fight between himself and Woods could be made, he would be ready for it.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/8205459.stm|title=Cleverly has Woods in his sights|work=BBC Sport |date=17 August 2009}}</ref>  Former champion Woods would go on to lose the fight and promptly announced his retirement from boxing.  On 25 September 2009 Cleverly was pipped to the prestigious Boxing Writers Club young boxer of the year award by only one vote losing out to British welterweight champion [[Kell Brook]] in what was the closest vote in the history of the award.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/8275556.stm|title=Cleverly beaten to award by Brook|work=BBC Sport |date=25 September 2009}}</ref>

On 9 October 2009 Cleverly defended both belts for the very first time against former Commonwealth games gold medallist Courtney Fry.  The fight, at the York Hall, resulted in an 8th round stoppage for Cleverly against a man who had been a successful amateur.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/8298604.stm|title=Cleverly sees off Fry challenge|work=BBC Sport |date=9 October 2009}}</ref>  Even more crucial for the Welshman was the news that prior to the fight he had been nominated to fight for the European title and that any loss to Fry would have scuppered those plans.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/8289929.stm|title=Cleverly targeting European belt|work=BBC Sport |date=4 October 2009}}</ref>

===European Champion===

The fight was won in the fifth round, the victory coming by way of knock out after two earlier knock downs in the previous round. In winning he became only the seventh Welshman to hold the British, Commonwealth and European titles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/8509520.stm|title=European title win for Welshman Nathan Cleverly|work=BBC Sport |date=13 February 2010}}</ref>  In addition to winning titles, Cleverly had during the same time period been studying for a Maths degree at [[Cardiff University]] eventually gaining a 2:2 degree.  Speaking after securing his degree in May 2010 he claimed the studying and the boxing combined had taken its toll saying ''"All the other students in my year have been able to concentrate full time on getting their degrees&nbsp;... But as well as crunching numbers, I've had to fight for the British, Commonwealth and European titles as well, and spend most evenings hitting the heavy bag and doing numerous press ups and sit ups."''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east_wales/10417896.stm|title=Boxer Cleverly earns maths degree|work=BBC News |date=25 June 2010}}</ref>

===WBO light heavyweight champion===
[[File:Nathan Cleverly 2010.jpg|thumb|Cleverly at the [[Cardiff City Stadium]] in Wales in August 2010.]]
On 18 September 2010 Cleverly faced the unbeaten [[Karo Murat]] at the LG Arena in Birmingham in an eliminator for the WBO light heavyweight title.  Cleverly moved one step closer to a match up with reigning champion [[Jürgen Brähmer]] with a ninth round TKO to win the fight which was one of the main events on Frank Warren's 'Magnificent Seven' event. Murat, a former European champion at super middleweight, struggled to match the Welshman after an explosive start and after being rocked in the 9th, the referee decided to stop the fight prior to the commencement of the 10th.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/8999684.stm|title=Impressive Welshman Nathan Cleverly defeats Karo Murat|work=BBC Sport |date=18 September 2010|last=Hassan|first=Nabil}}</ref>  Cleverly earned the interim version of the belt on 11 December 2010 in an unimpressive contest with the Frenchman Nadjib Mohammedi at the Echo Arena in Liverpool.<ref name="BBC/9272799">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/9272799.stm|title=Nathan Cleverly edges to points victory over Mohammedi|work=BBC Sport |date=11 December 2010}}</ref>  Winning 115–112, 116–111 and 115–113 on the scorecards despite also having a point deducted Cleverly described his opponent as "very awkward" and said "he was making me miss and dragging me in but this is the way it goes sometimes."<ref name="BBC/9272799" />  Cleverly had fought for the interim title as the full champion [[Jürgen Brähmer]] was in the midst of an appeal against a 16-month jail sentence for assault and insulting behaviour.<ref name="BBC/9272799" />  An appeal heard in Germany on 13 December 2010 would, if Brähmer had been unsuccessful and sent to prison, have resulted in the belt being vacated and Cleverly being upgraded to the full champion status.<ref name="BBC/9272799"/> Proceedings however didn't result in the champion being sent to prison and a fight with Brähmer was scheduled for 21 May 2011. Speaking of the match up Cleverly said that he was glad that it was going to happen saying "He's the champion and the only way I would consider myself a true champion is if I took the belt from him, rather than picking up the vacant title."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/9279684.stm|title=Nathan Cleverly world title shot with Braehmer set|work=BBC Sport |date=17 March 2011}}</ref>  Prior to the fight at [[The O2 Arena]] in London, Brähmer pulled out citing an eye injury received in training which had failed to heal properly.  The pullout resulted in the loss of the main event for the show and speculation that Cleverly would be awarded the full WBO title by default.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/13440189.stm|title=Cleverly title fight called off|work=BBC Sport |date=18 May 2011}}</ref>  Brähmer's replacement was found in undefeated British fighter [[Tony Bellew]], the current Commonwealth champion. Bellew, however, failed to make the weight and a second replacement was found in [[Poles|Polish]] veteran [[Aleksy Kuziemski]], a man ranked at number 11 in the world by the WBO.<ref name="kuziemski"/>  Despite the disruption, Cleverly, who had been awarded the full title following Brähmers pullout, made a successful first defence to retain the title.  The fight ended in the fourth round after a cut to the Kuziemski was deemed bad enough for the referee to stop the fight.<ref name="kuziemski"/>  Speaking of his achievement Cleverly said "I felt it was my destiny tonight&nbsp;... Ever since I first put the gloves on when I was 11 this was the night I've been dreaming of&nbsp;... Now I'll say Nathan Cleverly is the light-heavyweight champion of the world".<ref name="kuziemski">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/13460425.stm|title=Cleverly records first title win|work=BBC Sport |date=21 May 2011}}</ref>

====Title defences====
Cleverly made his first defence of his WBO title on 15 October 2011 with a hard fought majority points decision against [[Tony Bellew]] in Liverpool.<ref name="bellew">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/15315836.stm BBC Sport | Cleverly beats bellew to retain WBO title]</ref>  The fight, at the Echo Arena, was considered to be one of Cleverly's "hardest days in the office" with one judge scoring the contest a draw.<ref name="bellew"/>  The fight had an ill-tempered build up with the two clashing during the weigh in resulting in a hostile reception for the champion against the home challenger.<ref name="bellew"/>

Cleverly made his second defence of his WBO title returning to Wales for the first time since winning his WBO title on 25 February 2012 with a unanimous points decision against [[Tommy Karpency]].<ref name="karpency">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/boxing/17169329 BBC Sport | Nathan Cleverly holds on to world crown against Tommy Karpency]</ref>

Cleverly made his third defence of his WBO title - his first in the USA - with  an 8th-round stoppage against American Shawn Hawk in Los Angeles on 10 November 2012.

On 20 April 2013 Cleverly made his fourth defence against Robin Krasniqi winning by unanimous decision at the Wembley Arena.

He will make his fifth defence of the title against Russian Sergey Kovalev on 17 August 2013 at the Motorpoint Arena in Cardiff.
