==Professional career==

===Light-welterweight===
Bradley had his first professional bout on the 20th of August 2004, knocking out Francisco Martinez in the second round. In his rise through the ranks, he won the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] youth world welterweight and super lightweight crowns. He also beat future [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] lightweight champion [[Miguel Vazquez]] by a unanimous ten round decision.

====Bradley vs. Witter====
Bradley finally got his chance for a full world title when [[José Luis Castillo]] failed to make weight in a title eliminator for the WBC super lightweight belt. He then won the WBC super lightweight title by defeating British fighter [[Junior Witter]] in England.<ref>{{cite web|last=Christ|first=Scott|title=Bradley scores early Upset of the Year contender|url=http://www.badlefthook.com/2008/5/11/507447/bradley-scores-early-upset|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref> Bradley's bank account was down to $11 when he made the decision to go to England to fight Junior Witter. Bradley came into the fight a 6–1 underdog against Witter. During the fight, Bradley controlled most of the action, and dropped Witter in his corner during the 6th round. Though the fight was scored a close split decision for Bradley, most observers and analysts thought Bradley should have won the comfortable unanimous decision.

====Bradley vs. Holt====
On 4 April 2009, Bradley fought [[Kendall Holt]] to unify his WBC and Holt's [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] titles. Bradley was dropped in the first round by a huge left hook and was badly hurt but regrouped and outboxed Holt for most of the fight, before being sent to the canvas again in the 12th round. Nonetheless, Bradley got up and finished the fight. He won the fight by unanimous decision and became the new WBO champion.<ref>{{cite news

  | url =http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=535252
  | accessdate =2009-04-05 }}</ref>

Several days after his unification bout with Holt, Bradley was stripped of his WBC junior welterweight title, because of failure to fight [[Devon Alexander]], his mandatory challenger.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=4108299 WBC strips Timothy Bradley Jr. of junior welterweight title – ESPN]. Sports.espn.go.com (2009-04-28). Retrieved on 2012-01-15.</ref> As a result, the title became vacant and Alexander stopped Witter at the end of eight rounds to win the belt.
The Alexander-Witter fight was on the undercard of Bradley's August 1 fight with [[Nate Campbell]] in Bradley's hometown of Palm Springs. Campbell,a former lightweight champion, was coming up in weight after he failed to make the lightweight limit in his last fight. Bradley's fight with Campbell only lasted three rounds after Campbell chose not to continue when a cut formed over and behind his left eye. Bradley was awarded the TKO victory, but the verdict was later changed.<ref>[http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=20698&more=1 Bradley Defends WBO Strap With Controversial Victory Over Campbell On SHOWTIME]. Eastsideboxing.com (2009-08-02). Retrieved on 2012-01-15.</ref> A replay showed that the cut was caused by an accidental clash of heads. The rules state that if a fight is stopped by a cut caused by an accidental headbutt before the end of round four, it should be called a no contest. The [[California State Athletic Commission]] therefore changed the result.

====Bradley vs. Peterson====
On December 5, Bradley took on mandatory challenger and future light-welterweight champion, [[Lamont Peterson]]. Bradley dominated the fight, knocking Peterson down in the third round and went on to win a lopsided unanimous decision.

===Welterweight===
In his HBO Debut, Bradley was scheduled to face [[Luis Abregu]] in a nontitle bout at [[welterweight]]. However, Bradley's promoter told ESPN.com that he had made a deal with [[Golden Boy Promotions]] to fight [[Interim championship|Interim]] title holder and knockout artist [[Marcos Maidana]] at the [[Agua Caliente Casino]] in [[Rancho Mirage]], [[California]], only a few miles from Bradley's hometown of Palm Springs. The fight was scheduled to take place on June 19, but due to a back injury to Marcos Maidana the fight was postponed. So he went back to his original plan to move up in weight and the fight with Abregu was back on for July 17 at the Agua Caliente Casino.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=5208294 |title=Fight set for Bradley, Abregu| publisher= ESPN|date=2010-05-21|author= Rafael, Dan }}</ref>
Although clearly out-sized, Bradley proved too quick and too skilled for the hard-hitting Abregu winning by unanimous decision, with the judges' scorecards reading 119–111, 118–112 and 117–113.
At the end of the fight, Bradley openly made a challenge to pound-for-pound king [[Manny Pacquiao]], calling for him to "Come break down this wall." Bradley also called out Devon Alexander, [[Amir Khan (boxer)|Amir Khan]] and Marcos Maidana.

====Bradley vs. Alexander====
{{Main|Timothy Bradley vs. Devon Alexander}}
On January 29, 2011, Timothy Bradley defended his WBO junior welterweight title in a unification fight against fellow light welterweight title holder, WBC champion Devon Alexander, at the [[Silverdome|Silverdome Arena]] in [[Detroit]]. Bradley won via 10th round technical decision.

As stipulated in the contract of the fight against Devon Alexander, Bradley would be given a $1.3 million payday regardless of whomever he selected as his opponent for his next fight. While the public wanted Bradley to fight the then [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] light-welterweight champion Amir Khan and unify the division,{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Bradley opted to not take the fight.

====Stripped of WBC Title====
Timothy Bradley was stripped of his title as he refused to fight then World Boxing Association light-welterweight champion Amir Khan. Many have speculated that Bradley was not satisfied with the $1.3 million to fight a boxer of Amir Khan's caliber, although this was Bradley highest pay day in his entire career so far. Also, he had admitted that it was too risky to fight Amir Khan, asking rhetorically on the American radio show ''Leave It In The Ring'', "What if I lose then I am out the sweepstake to fight pound-for-pound-king Manny Pacquiao for 7.5 million dollars?"<ref>[http://beatsboxingmayhem.com/2011/04/27/timothy-bradley-turns-down-over-1-3-million-for-amir-khan-fight/ Timothy Bradley Turns Down Over $1.3 Million for Amir Khan Fight « Beats, Boxing and Mayhem]. Beatsboxingmayhem.com (2011-04-27). Retrieved on 2012-01-15.</ref> Bradley's refusal to take the fight led to a falling out between him and his promoter Gary Shaw. Subsequently he was stripped of the WBC title due to inactivity.<ref>[http://fighthype.com/pages/content10121.html Fighthype \\ Gary Shaw And Tim Bradley Heading To Litigation Soon?]. Fighthype.com (2011-06-12). Retrieved on 2012-01-15.</ref>

====Joins Top Rank====
Timothy Bradley joined [[Top Rank]] and made his debut with them November 2011 when he defeated [[Joel Casamayor]] on the under card of Marquez-Pacquiao III.

On November 12, 2011, Bradley defended his WBO junior welterweight title against former [[lightweight]] titlist Joel Casamayor, 40, on the undercard of [[Manny Pacquiao vs. Juan Manuel Marquez III]]. Bradley won by TKO in the eighth round in making his case for a shot at Pacquiao.

===Return to Welterweight===

====Bradley vs. Pacquiao====
{{See also|Manny Pacquiao vs. Timothy Bradley}}
Bradley fought [[Manny Pacquiao]] on June 9, 2012 for Pacquiao's WBO welterweight title. Bradley scored a controversial victory over Pacquiao by way of split decision, with two of the judges scoring it 115–113 to Bradley and the other 115–113 to Pacquiao. The decision ended Pacquiao's 7-year undefeated streak and gave Bradley the title. According to Compubox, Pacquiao was ahead in punches landed, power punches landed, percentage of punches landed, and percentage of power punches landed. As a result of the controversial scoring, a special five-judge panel was created by World Boxing WBO President Francisco "Paco" Valcarcel to review the fight. All five judges of the panel reviewed a video of the bout and all scored it in favor of [[Manny Pacquiao]]. Two judges scored it 117–111, while the other three scored it 118–110, 116–112 and 115–113. Despite the panel's findings, WBO rules do not allow the decision to be overturned. The most the boxing body can do, according to Valcarcel, is to order a rematch.<ref>[http://ph.sports.yahoo.com/news/wbo-says-pacquiao-beat-bradley.html WBO says Pacquiao won; Manny wants rematch – Yahoo!
