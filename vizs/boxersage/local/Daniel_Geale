==Pro career==
Geale turned pro in 2004, knocking out Danny Bellert in the third round.  He then went on to build a record of 17 bouts for 17 wins with 12 KO's. On 14 December 2007, Geale fought for the [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] Middleweight Championship of the world against another undefeated Australian, [[Daniel Dawson]], who was 29-0-0 with 20 KO's coming into the fight.  Geale outclassed Dawson over 12 rounds to win the IBO Middlewight title with the judges scoring the bout 120-110, 120-110 and 119-109.

In June 2008, Geale defended his IBO Middleweight Championship with another 12 round unanimous decision over [[Geard Ajetovic]]. In December 2008, Geale faced [[Daniel McKinnon (boxer)|Daniel McKinnon]] in a non title bout.  Geale was down in the 8th, McKinnon was down in the 4th, 6th & twice in the 8th, Geale won a unanimous decision with judges scoring the bout 100-87, 100-87, 100-88. In March 2009 Geale defeated [[Ian MacKillop]] with a first round knockout but in May of that year he lost his next fight in a controversial split decision to former [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] super middleweight champion [[Anthony Mundine]] to lose his [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] middleweight title. Mundine later stated that he hardly studied Geale during his training camp for the fight. Geale however, would rebound from the controversial defeat with 3 wins including an IBF Eliminator setting himself up for a world title shot.

===1st Middleweight Major Title===

In May 2011, Geale defeated [[Sebastian Sylvester]] in Germany by split decision (scores of 118-110, 118-112, 110-118) to become the new [[IBF]] middleweight world champion. In August 2011, he made his first successful title defense against contender Eromosele Albert, winning by unanimous decision. Geale made his second successful IBF title defense by defeating [[Ghana|Ghana's]] [[Osumanu Adama]] via unanimous decision (scores of 118-110, 117-111, 115-113) on the 7th Of March 2012.

===Title unification against Felix Sturm & 2nd Major Title===

On 1 September 2012 Geale defeated long time WBA champion [[Felix Sturm]] in [[Oberhausen]], Germany via split decision (scores of 116-112, 116-112, 112-116)<ref>http://www.foxsports.com.au/other-sports/boxing/daniel-geale-wins-unification-title-bout-with-split-points-decision-over-germanys-felix-sturm/story-e6frf5h3-1226463236666</ref> and became the 4th Australian to have been a unified boxing world champion.

Two months after winning the WBA title, Geale was stripped of it for choosing to fight [[Anthony Mundine]] in a rematch over mandatory challenger [[Gennady Golovkin]]. Geale was punished for Sturm's refusal to fight mandatory challengers when he was champion. When Geale won the title, the WBA gave him four-and-a-half months instead of the regular nine to defend against the mandatory - in this case Golovkin. Their reasoning was that their mandatory challengers had been ignored for too long.<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/other-sports/boxing/wba-strips-daniel-geale-of-middleweight-title-for-fighting-anthony-mundine-instead-of-gennardy-golovkin/story-e6frf5h3-1226509061727#.UQvGwb89OSp Geale Stripped of WBA title], [[Fox Sports Australia]], 2 November 2012</ref>

===Mundine Rematch===

On January 30, 2013 Geale beat Anthony Mundine in a unanimous points decision (scores of 116-112, 117-111, 117-111) at the Sydney Entertainment Centre to retain his IBF middleweight world title. 
Immediately after ring announcer Jimmy Lennon Jr. read out the result, Mundine and his entourage stormed out of the ring and left the arena.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-01-31/geale-dominates-mundine-to-win-re-match/4492386?section=sport Geale dominates Mundine to win re-match], [[Ciaran Baynes]], [[ABC News Online]], 30 January 2013</ref>
